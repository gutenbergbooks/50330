  <h2 class='c008'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Everyone</span> who has to do with children at the
present day, directly or indirectly, must in some
form or another have felt the difficulty of instructing
them in the details of religious faith, without
leaving them open to the assaults of doubt hereafter,</p>
<p class='c010'>when they encounter the results of scientific
inquiry.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes the old truths and the new truths
seem to conflict; and though everyone must be
aware that such internecine warfare between truths
can be an appearance only, the reconciliation is not
easily perceived: nor is the task simplified by the
hostile attitude adopted towards each other by some
of the upholders of orthodox Christianity.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is sometimes said to be impossible for a teacher
to educate a class subject to compulsory attendance,
in a spirit of weal-th, peace, and godliness, without
infringing the legitimate demands of somebody;
but the difficulty is caused chiefly by sectarian
animosity, which may take a variety of forms.</p>

<p class='c010'>These religious and educational disputes would be
of small consequence, and might even be stimulating
<span class='pageno' title='viii' id='Page_viii'></span>to thought and fervour, were it not that one danger
is imminent:—a danger lest the nation, in despair of
a happier settlement, should consent to a system of
<i>compulsory</i> secularism; and forbid, in the public part
of the curriculum of elementary schools, not only
any form of worship, but any mention of a Supreme
Being, and any quotation from the literature left us
by the Saints, Apostles, Prophets, of all ages.</p>

<p class='c010'>If so excentric a negation is brought about by the
warfare of denominations, they will surely all regard
it as a lamentable result.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile, in the hope and belief that the great
bulk of the teachers of this country are eager and
anxious to do their duty, and lead the children
committed to their care along the ways of righteousness,—being
deterred therefrom in some cases only
by the difficulty of following out their ideals amid
the turmoil of voices, and in other cases by their
uncertainty of how far the “old paths” can still
be pursued in the light of modern knowledge,—I
have attempted the task of formulating the fundamentals,
or substance,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> of religious faith in terms of
Divine Immanence,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a> in such a way as to assimilate
sufficiently all the results of existing knowledge, and
still to be in harmony with the teachings of the
poets and inspired writers of all ages. The statement
<span class='pageno' title='ix' id='Page_ix'></span>is intended to deny nothing which can reasonably
be held by any specific Denomination, and it
seeks to affirm nothing but what is consistent with
universal Christian experience.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our knowledge of the Christian religion is
admittedly derived from information verbally communicated,
and from documents; and, in the interpretation
of these sources, mistakes have been made.
At one time, not long ago, it was the duty of serious
students of all kinds to point out some of these
mistakes, wherever they ran counter to sense and
knowledge. That cleaning and sweetening work has
been done vigorously, and done well: at the present
time comparatively little sweeping remains to be
done, save in holes and corners: most of the lost
simplicity has now been found. A positive or constructive
statement of religious doctrine, not indeed
deduced from present knowledge, but in harmony
with all that bears upon the subject, is now more
useful. Such a statement might be called New
Light on Old Paths; for the “old paths” remain,
and are more brightly illuminated than ever: even
the old Genesis story of man’s early experience
shines out as a brilliant inspiration. Truth always
grows in light and beauty the more it is uncovered.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are still people who endeavour to deny or
disbelieve the discoveries of science. They are
setting themselves athwart the stream, and trying
<span class='pageno' title='x' id='Page_x'></span>to stop its advance;—they only succeed in stopping
their own. They are good people, but unwise, and,
moreover, untrustful. If they will let go their
anchorage, and sail on in a spirit of fearless faith,
they will find an abundant reward, by attaining a
deeper insight into the Divine Nature, and a wider
and brighter outlook over the destiny of man.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There is a growing conception of religion which
regards it not as a thing for special hours or special
days, but as a reality permeating the whole of life.
The old attempt to partition off a region where
Divine action is appropriate, from another region
in which such action would be out of place—the old
superstition that God does one thing and not another,
that He speaks more directly through the thunder of
catastrophe or the mystery of miracle than through
the quiet voice of ordinary existence—all this is
beginning to show signs of expiring in the light of a
coming day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those to whom such a change is welcome regard
it as of the utmost importance that this incipient
recognition of a Deity immanent in History and in
all the processes of Nature shall be guided and
elevated and made secure. Ancient formularies
must be reconsidered and remodelled if they are
to continue to express eternal verities in language
corresponding to the enlarged acquaintance with
natural knowledge now possessed by humanity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nevertheless the attempt to draw up anything of
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>the nature of a creed or catechism, unhallowed by
centuries of emotion and aspiration, is singularly
difficult; and to obtain general acceptance for such a
production may be impossible.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every Denomination is likely to prefer its own
creed or formula, especially if it has the aroma of
antiquity upon it—an aroma of high value for religious
purposes and more easily destroyed than replaced.
No carefully drawn statement can be expected to go
far enough to satisfy religious enthusiasts: it is not
possible to satisfy both scientific and distinctively
denominational requirements. All this might be
admitted, and yet it may be possible to lay a sound
foundation such as can stand scientific scrutiny and
reasonable rationalistic attack—a foundation which
may serve as a basis for more specific edification
among those who are capable of sustaining a loftier
structure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even though not yet fully attainable, it is permissible
to hope for more union than exists at
present among professing Christians, and among the
branches of the Christian Church. With some
excellent people the differences and distinguishing
marks loom out as of special importance; but from
these I can hardly claim attention. I must speak to
those who try to seize points of agreement, and who
long for the time when all Christian workers may be
united in effort and friendliness and co-operation,
though not in all details of doctrine. On the practical
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>side, a concurrence of effort for the amelioration and
spiritualisation of human life, in the light of a common
gospel and a common hope, is not impossible; and
on the theoretical side, in spite of legitimate differences
of belief on difficult and infinite problems, there must
be a mass of fundamental material on which a great
majority are really agreed.</p>

<p class='c013'>But a foundation is not to be mistaken for superstructure:
a full-fledged and developed religion needs
a great deal more than foundation—there must be a
building too. The warmth and vitality imparted by
strong religious conviction is a matter of common
observation, and is a force of great magnitude; but
it is a personal and living thing, it cannot be embodied
in a formula or taught in a class. Here lies the
proper field of work of the Churches. What can be
taught in a school is the fundamental substratum
underlying all such developments and personal aspirations;
and it can be dealt with on a basis of historical
and scientific fact, interpreted and enlarged by the
perceptions and experiences of mankind.</p>

<p class='c013'>A creed or catechism should not be regarded as
something superhuman, infallible, and immutable; it
should be considered to be what it really is—a careful
statement of what, in the best light of the time, can
be regarded as true and important about matters
partially beyond the range of scientific knowledge:
it must always reach farther into the unknown than
science has yet explored.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>An element of mystery and difficulty is not inappropriate
in a creed, although it may be primarily
intended for comprehension by children. Bare bald
simplicity of statement, concerning things keenly felt
but imperfectly known, cannot be perfectly accurate;
and yet every effort should be made to combine
accuracy and simplicity to the utmost. Every word
should be carefully weighed and accurately used:
mere conventional terminology should be eschewed.
A sentence stored in the memory may evolve different
significations at different periods of life, and at no
one period need it be completely intelligible or
commonplace. The ideal creed should be profound
rather than explicit, and yet should convey some
sort of meaning even to the simplest and most
ignorant. Its terms, therefore, should not be technical,
though for full comprehension they would have to be
understood in a technical or even a recondite sense.</p>

<p class='c013'>To make a statement of this kind useful, it is
necessary to accompany each clause with some indication
of the supplementary teaching necessary to
make it assimilable: and such hints should be
adapted not only to professed teachers, but to parents
and all who have to do directly or indirectly with the
education of children. It is my hope that the
following clauses and explanations may be of some
use also to the many who experience some difficulty
in recognising the old landmarks amid the rising
flood of criticism, and who at one time or another
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>have felt shaken in their religious faith. Some of
them are sure to have attained emancipation and
conviction for themselves, but in so far as their own
insight has led them in the general direction indicated
by what follows, these will not be the last to welcome
an explicit statement, even though in several places
they may wish to modify and amend it. They
will recognise that there is an advantage, for some
purposes, in throwing old and over-familiar formulæ
into new modes of expression; and that a variety in
mode of formulation does not necessarily indicate
a lack of appreciation of the loftiest truths yet vouchsafed
to humanity.</p>

<p class='c013'>With these preliminary remarks I now submit a
catechism, whereof the clauses are intended to be
consistent with the teachings of Science in its widest
sense, as well as with those of Literature and Philosophy,
and to lead up to the substance or substratum
of a religious creed.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>I<br /> <br />THE ASCENT OF MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q.  What are you?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i>  I am a being alive and conscious upon
this earth; a descendant of ancestors who rose
by gradual processes from lower forms of
animal life, and with struggle and suffering
became man.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
  <h2 class='c022'>CLAUSE I</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This answer does not pretend to exhaust the
nature of man; another aspect is dealt with in
Clause XII. It is usual to impart the latter mode of
statement first; but premature dwelling on the more
mystical aspect of human nature, with ignorance or
neglect of the biological facts actually ascertained
concerning it, only gives rise to troubled thought in
the future when the material facts become known—often
in crude or garbled form—and leads to
scepticism.</p>

<p class='c013'>The clause as it stands is a large and comprehensive
statement, that will need much time for its
elucidation and adequate comprehension. Its separate
terms may be considered thus:—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Earth.</span>—Children can gradually be assisted to
realise the earth as an enormous globe of matter,
with vast continents and oceans on its surface and
with a clinging atmosphere, the whole moving very
rapidly (nineteen miles each second) through space,
and constituting one of a number of other planets
all revolving round the sun. They may also be led
to realise that from the distance of a million miles
it would appear as an object in the sky rather like
the moon; that from a greater distance it would look
like any of the other planets; while from a vastly
greater distance neither it nor any other planet is
large or luminous enough to be visible—nothing but
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>the sun would then be seen, looking like a star. It is
occasionally helpful to realise that the earth, with all
its imperfections, is one of the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Being.</span>—The mystery of existence may be lightly
touched upon. The fact that anything whatever—even
a stone—exists, raises unanswerable questions
of whence and why. It is instructive to think of
some rocks as agglomerations of sand, and of sand
as water-worn fragments of previous rock; so that,
even here, there arises a sense of infinitude.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Alive.</span>—The nature of life and, consequently, of
death is unknown, but life is associated with rapid
chemical changes in complex molecules, and is
characterised by the powers or faculties of assimilation,
growth, and reproduction. It is a property we
share with all animals and also with plants. Children
should not be told this in bald fashion, but by
judicious questioning should be led to perceive the
essence of it for themselves. Soon after they realise
what is meant by life, some of them will perceive that
it has an enormous range of application, and will
think of flowers as possessing it also: being subject
like all living things to disease and death.</p>

<p class='c013'>What plants do not possess is the specifically
animal power of purposed locomotion, of hunting
for food and comfort, with its associated protective
penalty of pain.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Conscious.</span>—Here we come to something specially
distinctive of higher animal life. Probably it makes
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>its incipient appearance low down in the scale, in
vague feelings of pain or discomfort, and of pleasure;
though it is not likely that worms are as conscious as
they appear to us to be. In its higher grades consciousness
means awareness of the world and of ourselves,
a discrimination between the self and the external
world—“self-consciousness” in its proper signification:
an immense subject that can only be hinted at to
children. They can, however, be taught to have some
appreciation of the senses, or channels, whereby our
experience of external nature is gained; and to
perceive that the way in which we apprehend the
universe is closely conditioned by the particular
sense-organs which in the struggle for existence have
been evolved by all the higher kinds of animal life,—organs
which we men are now beginning to put to
the unfamiliar and novel use of scientific investigation
and cosmic interpretation. What wonder if we make
mistakes, and are narrow and limited in our outlook!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Digression on the Senses</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Our fundamental interpretative sense is that of
touch—the muscular sense generally. Through it
we become aware of space, of time, and of matter.
The experience of <i>space</i> arises from free motion,
especially locomotion; <i>speed</i> is a direct sensation;
and <i>time</i> is the other factor of speed. Time is
measured by any uniformly moving body—that is
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>by space and speed together. Muscular action impeded,
the sense of <i>force</i> or resistance, is another
primary sensation; and by inference from this arises
our notion of “matter,” which is sometimes spoken of
as a permanent possibility of sensation. Hardness
and softness, roughness and smoothness, are all
inferences from varieties of touch. Another sense
allied to touch is that of <i>temperature</i>, whereby we
obtain primitive ideas concerning heat. Then there
are the chemical senses of taste and smell; and
lastly, the two senses which enable us to draw inferences
respecting things at a distance. These two
attract special attention; for the information which
they convey, though less fundamental than that given
by the muscular sense, is of the highest interest and
enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ear is an instrument for the appreciation
of aerial vibrations, or ripples in the air. They
may give us a sense of harmony; and in any case
they enable us to infer something concerning the
vibrating source which generated them, so that we
can utilise them, by a prearranged code, for purposes
of intelligent communication with each other—a
process of the utmost importance, to which we have
grown so accustomed that its wonder is masked.</p>

<p class='c013'>The eye is an instrument for appreciating ripples
in the ether. These are generated by violently
revolving electric charges associated with each atom
of matter, and are delayed, stopped, and reflected in
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>various ways, by other matter which they encounter
in their swift passage through the ethereal medium.</p>

<p class='c013'>From long practice and inherited instinct we are
able, from the small fraction of these ripples which
enter our eyes, to make inferences regarding the
obstructive objects from which they have been
shimmered and scattered. It is like inferring the
ships and boats and obstacles in a harbour from the
pattern of the reflected ripples which cross each other
on the surface of the water.</p>

<p class='c013'>The precision and clearness with which we can
thus gain knowledge concerning things beyond our
reach, and the extraordinary amount of information
that can be thus conveyed, are nothing short of
miraculous: though, again, we are liable to treat sight
as an everyday and commonplace faculty. We are
not, however, directly conscious of the ripples, though
they are the whole exciting cause of the sensation;
our real consciousness and perception are of the
objects which have invested the ripples with their
peculiarities, have imprinted upon them certain characteristics,
and made them what they are. The eye
is able to analyse all this, as the ear analyses the
tones of an orchestra.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Ancestors.</span>—In the first instance <i>human</i> ancestors
may be considered, and a family tree drawn for any one
child; from which he will learn how large a number of
persons combine to form his ancestry. The tree can
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>also represent the converging effect of inter-marriages,
so that ultimate descent from a common ancestor is not
an impossibility, if the facts of biology and ethnology
point in that direction—as it appears they do. The
probable though remote relationship existing between
all the branches of the human family may be suggested
by an inverted tree descending from some
remotest ancestor: for whom Noah is as good a
name as any other.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Rose.</span>—The doctrine of the ascent of man may
be found in some cases to conflict with early religious
teaching. If so, offence and iconoclasm should
be carefully avoided; and if the teacher feels that he
can conscientiously draw a distinction, between the
persistent vital or spiritual essence of man, and the
temporary material vehicle which displays his individual
existence amid terrestrial surroundings, he
may with advantage do so. The second or higher
aspect of the origin of man is dealt with in Clause XII.
The history and origin of the spiritual part of man is
unknown, and can only be rightly spoken of in terms
of mysticism and poetry: the history of the bodily
and much of the mental part is studied in the
biological facts of evolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>The doctrine of the ascent of man, properly
regarded, is a doctrine of much hope and comfort.
Truly it is an unusual item in a child’s creed; but
it is, I think, a helpful item: it explains much that
would otherwise be dark, and it instils hope for the
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>future. For in the light of an evolution doctrine
we can readily admit—(1) that low and savage
tendencies are naturally to be expected at certain
stages, for an evanescent moment; and (2) that
having progressed thus far, we may anticipate further—perhaps
unlimited—advance for mankind.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fact that each individual organism hastily
runs through, or reduplicates, a main part of the
series of stages in the life-history of its race, is a
fact of special interest and significance; notably in
connection with the trials and temptations of human
beings during their effort to cleanse away the traces
of animal nature. The severity of the contest is
already lessening, and both the individual and the
race may look forward to a time when the struggles
and failures are nearly over, when the unruliness of
passion is curbed, when at length we</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hear no yelp of the beast, and the man is quiet at last</div>
      <div class='line'>As he stands on the heights of his life with a glimpse of a height</div>
      <div class='line in2'>that is higher.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Gradual Processes.</span>—The slowness and precariousness
of evolution may be indicated; and the
possibility of descent or degeneration, as well as of
ascent and development, must be insisted on. A genealogical
tree can be drawn laterally, to illustrate the
origin of any set of animals—both those risen and those
fallen in the scale—from some, possibly hypothetical,
common ancestor. The dog on the one hand, and
the wolf or jackal on the other, may serve as easy
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>examples of ascent and descent respectively, and of
relationship between higher and lower species, or even
genera, without direct or obvious connection. The
horse and the bear may serve as examples of distant
relationship; birds and reptiles as another; and we
may point out that at each stage of inheritance some
of the progeny may ascend a little in the scale, and
some descend a little.</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently the sponge of time may wipe out the
common ancestry at the root of the lateral tree,
and nothing be left but some of its ascending and
some of its descending branches,—all suited to their
environment and so continuing to live and flourish,
each in its own way; but so apparently different, that
relationship between them is a matter of inference,
and is sometimes difficult to believe in. The example
of the caterpillar and butterfly, however, of the tadpole
and the frog, etc., can be used to remove incredulity
at extraordinary and instructive transmutations—transmutations
which in the individual represent
rapidly some analogous movements of racial development
in the history of the distant past. The
degradation of certain free-swimming animals, such
as ascidians, which in old age become rooted or
sessile like plants, can be pointed to as typical, and,
indeed, a true representation of what has gone on in
a race also, during long periods of time. The rapid
passage of the embryo through its ancestral chain
of development should be known, at any rate to
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>the teacher; and in general the greater the teacher’s
acquaintance with natural history, the more living
and interesting will be the series of lessons that can
occasionally be given on this part of the clause.</p>

<p class='c013'>The popular misconception concerning the biological
origin of man, that he is descended from
monkeys like those of the present day, is a trivial
garbling of the truth. The elevated and the degraded
branches of a family can both trace their descent
from a parent stock; and though the distant common
ancestor may now be lost in obscurity, there is
certainly in this sense a blood relationship between
the quadrumana and the bimana: a relationship
which is recognised and is practically useful in the
investigations of experimental pathology.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Lower Forms of Animal Life.</span>—The existence
of single cells and other low microscopic forms
(like amœbæ), and the analysis or dissection of
a more complex structure (say rhubarb) into the
cells of which it is in a sense composed, together
with some indication of the vital processes occurring
in similar but isolated cells (such as yeast
or protococcus) which lead us to consider them as
possessing life—of a form so fundamental that there is
in some cases no clear discrimination between animal
and vegetable—may be spoken of and exhibited in
the microscope.</p>

<p class='c013'>From a not very different-looking minute germinal
vesicle, or nucleus of a cell, the chick is developed.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>The lower forms of animal life, spoken of in the
clause as ancestral, may be understood to go back to
forms even as low as these,—indeed, to the lowest
and minutest forms which in dim and distant ages
can have possessed any of the incipient characteristics
of life at all: down, perhaps, to some unknown process
whereby the earthy particles began to coalesce under
a vivifying influence. And as the race springs from
lowly forms of cell life, so does the individual,—the
body of each individual was once no more than
a microscopic cell-nucleus or germinal vesicle.
Therein was the germ of life: and the complex
aggregate of cells we now possess has all been put
together by the directive power latent in, or initially
manifested by, that germ. So it is also with a seed—an
apple pip, an acorn, or a grain of mustard seed.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there are many forms of animal life not in the
direct line of our ancestry—side branches, as it were,
of the great terrestrial family. At present the earth
is dominated by man, but at one time it was mastered
by gigantic reptiles, larger than any land creature of
to-day, the remains of which are occasionally found
fossilised into stone and embedded in the rocks; fit
to be collected and preserved in museums.</p>

<p class='c013'>For millions of years the earth was inhabited by
creatures no higher than these; the progress upwards
has been slow and patient: time is infinitely long,
and the great history of the world is still working
itself out.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>Still do lower forms exist side by side with higher;
and many of them are suited to their surroundings,
and in their place are beautiful and sane and perfect
of their kind. But a few of the lower forms are lower
because they have failed to reach the standard of
their race, they are very far from any kind of perfection,
they are at war with their environment; and
for these, the only alternatives are extinction or
improvement. In such a species as man the variety
or range of achievement and of elevation is enormous.
Among men and their works we find, on the one
hand, cathedrals and oratorios and poems, and faith
and charity and hope; on the other, slums and ugliness
and prisons, and spite and cruelty and greed.
And we must not forget that want of harmony with
environment may in some cases be the fault, not of
the individual, but of the environment: a fault
which it is specially likely to possess when man-made.
For every now and then is born an individual
far above the average of the race, amid surroundings
which he finds deadly and depressing. He may be
despised and rejected by his fellows, and nevertheless
may be the precursor or herald of a nobler
future.</p>

<p class='c013'>The problem, the main human problem, is how to
deal with the earth now—now that we have at length
attained to conscious control—so as to cease perpetuating
the lower forms, and to encourage the production
of the higher; by giving to all children born
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>on the planet a fair chance of becoming, each in its
own way, a noble specimen of developed humanity.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Struggle and Suffering.</span>—Children should
realise the bleak and unprotected state through which
their remote ancestors must have begun a human existence,
the great dangers which they had to overcome,
the contests with beasts and with the severities of
climate, the hardships and perils and straits through
which they passed; and should be grateful to those
unknown pioneers of the human race, to whose
struggles and suffering and discoveries and energies
our present favoured mode of existence on the planet
is due.</p>

<p class='c013'>The more people realise the effort that has preceded
them and made them possible, the more are they
likely to endeavour to be worthy of it: the more
pitiful also will they feel when they see individuals
failing in the struggle upward and falling back
towards a brute condition; and the more hopeful
they will ultimately become for the brilliant future
of a race which from such lowly and unpromising
beginnings has produced the material vehicle necessary
for those great men who flourished in the recent
epoch which we speak of as antiquity; and has been
so guided, since then, as to develop the magnificence
of a Newton and a Shakespeare even on this island
in the northern seas.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>II<br /> <br />THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONSCIENCE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 2.  What, then, may be meant by the Fall
of man?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> At a certain stage of development man
became conscious of a difference between right
and wrong, so that thereafter, when his actions
fell below a normal standard of conduct, he felt
ashamed and sinful. He thus lost his animal
innocency, and entered on a long period of
human effort and failure; nevertheless, the
consciousness of degradation marked a rise in
the scale of existence.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
  <h2 class='c022'>CLAUSE II</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This clause has been inserted because of the historic,
though often mistaken, notions accreted round
a legend of Fall and of a Paradise lost; and it is of
interest to detect the germ of truth which these
ancient ideas contain. It may be regarded as
really an appendage of, or introductory to, the next
clause.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sense of guilt and shame is to some extent
displayed by a dog; but it appears to be due
to domestication, and to be a secondary result of
human influence. In any case, it is certainly only
the higher animals that thus exhibit the germ of
conscience, and the sense of shame and remorse: a
sense which is most real and genuine when it is
independent of externally inflicted and of expected
punishment. Wild animals appear to have no such
feeling, they glory in what we may picturesquely
speak of as their “misdeeds,” and in running the
gauntlet of danger to achieve them; and though
often cruel, they are free from sin. Some savages—our
own Norse forefathers among others—must on
their freebooting expeditions have been in similar
case. So were some of the Homeric heroes. It
would be only the highest and most thoughtful
among them that could rise to the sense of guilt and
degradation. Only those who have risen are liable
to fall. The summit of manhood is attained when
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>evil is consciously overcome. The period before it
was recognised as such has been called the golden
age; but the condition of unconsciousness of evil,
though joyous, is manifestly inferior to the state
ultimately attainable, when paradise is regained
through struggle and victory.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mere innocency, the freedom from sin by reason
only of lack of perception, is not the highest state;
it has been thought ideal from the point of view of
inspiration and poetry, but it is a condition in which
advance is necessarily limited. Sooner or later fuller
knowledge and consciousness must arrive; and then
ensues a long period of discipline and distress, until
first a Leader and ultimately the race find their
way out, through temptation and difficulty, once more
to freedom and joy.</p>

<p class='c013'>A perception that the possibility of backsliding is a
necessary ingredient in the making of man, and the
consequent discernment of a soul of goodness in
things evil, constitute a large part of the teaching of
Browning:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>The intervening period between fall and victory,
between loss of innocency and gain of righteousness,
is the period with which all human history is concerned:

and longs for light.</p>

<p class='c013'>Immense is the area still to be traversed and

a coming dawn. Yet a time will come when we

</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 3.  What is the distinctive characteristic
of man?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> The distinctive character of man is that
he has a sense of responsibility for his acts,
having acquired the power of choosing between
good and evil, with freedom to obey one motive
rather than another.</p>

<p class='c020'>Creatures far below the human level are
irresponsible; they feel no shame and suffer
no remorse; they are said to have no conscience.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Character of Manhood</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In putting this question, children may be asked to
suggest characteristics which distinguish man from
animals. If gradually they hit upon clothes and
fire and speech they will do well.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Clothes</i> may be defined as artificial covering
removable at will; “artificial” meaning made by
an artificer, or manufactured, as opposed to natural
growth, like fur. But the changes of covering
among animals should not be overlooked: moulting
for instance, renewal of skin necessitated by growth,
protective change of colour at summer and winter,
and so on.</p>

<p class='c013'>The discovery of <i>Fire</i> is a thing to be emphasised,
because familiarity with lucifer matches is liable to
engender contempt for this great pre-historic discovery.
People should realise that at one time the
production of flame <i>de novo</i> was extremely difficult:
the ordinary method of lighting fires being to keep
some one fire always alight, so that brands could
be ignited at it and thus it could be spread. The
fact that lighting other fires does not diminish or
weaken the original stock, is noteworthy, and is an
analogy with life which may be typified by oaks
and acorns—any number of trees arising from a
parent stock, and spreading for innumerable generations.
The ancient ceremony of keeping flames
alight on sacred altars was doubtless due to the
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>difficulty of re-ignition when every fire in a village
had accidentally become extinguished. That the
ancients valued fire highly, and felt strongly the
difficulty of generating it, is shown by the legend
that the first fire must have been stolen from
heaven; and the priests taught, as usual in barbarous
times, that the gods were jealous and angry at man’s
discoveries and the progress of science.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Speech</i> and <i>language</i> is a most vital characteristic
of manhood, and is largely responsible for the chasm
between him and other animals. The gestures and
noises of animals must not be overlooked, however,
and they often seem to have mysterious modes
of communication of some kind. But they have
nothing akin to <i>writing</i>, and this portentous discovery
enables not merely communication between
contemporary living men, but an accumulation of
information and experience throughout the centuries;
so that a man is no longer dependent solely on
his own individual experience, but is able to draw
upon the records and wisdom of the past. Owing
to this power of recording and handing on information,
a discovery once made becomes the possession
of the human race henceforth for ever—unless it
relapses into barbarism.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Will</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>None of these characteristics, however, is emphasised
in the clause, because they lead too far afield if
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>pursued. For our present purpose we regard the
sense of “conscience,” suggested by the previous
answer, as the most important and highest characteristic
of all,—the sense of responsibility, the power of
self-determination, the building up of character, so
that ultimately it becomes impossible to be actuated
by unworthy motives. Our actions are now controlled
not by external impulses only, but largely by our
own characters and wills. The man who is the
creature of impulse, or the slave of his passions,
cannot be said to be his own master, or to be really
free; he drifts hither and thither according to the
caprice or the temptation of the moment, he is
untrustworthy and without solidity or dignity of
character. The free man is he who can control
himself, who does not obey every idea as it occurs to
him, but weighs and determines for himself, and is not
at the mercy of external influences. This is the real
meaning of choice and free will. It does not mean
that actions are capricious and undetermined; but
that they are determined by nothing less than the
totality of things. They are not determined by the
external world alone, so that they can be calculated
and predicted from outside: they are determined by
self and external world together. A free man is the
master of his motives, and selects that motive which
he wills to obey.</p>

<p class='c013'>If he chooses wrongly, he suffers; he is liable also
to make others suffer, and he feels remorse. In a
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>high grade of existence no other punishment is
necessary. Artificial punishment has for its object
the production of artificial remorse, in creatures too
low as yet for the genuine feeling. Artificial punishment
can be easily exaggerated and misapplied, and
should be employed with extreme caution. It is
always ambitious and often dangerous, though sometimes
justifiable and necessary, to attempt to take
the place of Providence. Even between parents and
children, enforcement of another’s will may be
overdone, till the power of self-control and the
instinct of duty are impaired.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sense of responsibility inevitably grows with
power and knowledge, and is proportional thereto.
By means of drugs a grown man may enfeeble his
will till he becomes in some sense irresponsible for
his actions; but he is not irresponsible for his wilful
destruction of a human faculty; and in so far as
he is dangerous to others he must be treated
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>The struggle in man’s nature between the better
and the worse elements,—sometimes spoken of as
a struggle between dual personalities, and otherwise
depicted as a conflict between the flesh and the
spirit,—is a natural consequence of our double
ancestry (spoken of in Clause XII.), our ascent from
animal fellow-creatures, and our relationship with a
higher order of being. No man in his sober senses
really wills to do evil: he does it with some motive
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>which he tries to think justifies it; or else he does it
against his real will because mastered by something
lower. So Plato teaches in the <i>Gorgias</i>. And St.
Paul says the same thing:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The good which I would, I do not; but the evil
which I would not, that I do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The conflict is often a period of torment and
misery. “O, wretched man that I am! who shall
deliver me from the body of this death?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Whenever the better nature prevails in the struggle,
there is a mystic sense of strength and comfort
universally testified to by humanity, even though the
victory results in temporal loss or persecution;
“in all these things we are more than conquerors.”
And this fact corresponds with part of the answer
to Question 6 below.</p>

<p class='c013'>We can recognise that our evil impulses are the
natural remnant of bestial ancestry, and need not be
due to diabolical promptings. An animal, though
perhaps innocent from lack of knowledge, is bound
and enslaved by its instincts; for instance, the
apparently intelligent and social bee is driven by
racial instincts into a prescribed course of action; a
cat can no more refrain from trying to catch a bird
than a man of high nature can allow himself to
commit a crime.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weak man often allows his brute nature to get
the upper hand and enslave his higher self, and he
hates himself afterwards for the degradation so
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>caused; but the strong and free man takes control,
and dominates his animal nature.</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 4.  What is the duty of man?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> To assist his fellows, to develop his own
higher self, to strive towards good in every
way open to his powers, and generally to seek
to know the laws of Nature and to obey the
will of God; in whose service alone can be
found that harmonious exercise of the faculties
which is identical with perfect freedom.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The laws of nature signify the ascertained processes
and consistencies observable in all surrounding things;
they are a special and partial, but accurately ascertainable,
aspect of what is called the will of God. They
cannot be broken or really disobeyed; but we may
set ourselves in fruitless antagonism to them,—as by
building a bridge too weak to stand, by various kinds
of wrong conduct, eating unduly or wrong kind of
food, by careless sanitation and neglect of health.
But all such ignorance or neglect of the laws of nature
involves disaster. By knowing them, and acting with
them, we show wisdom; and by steady persistence in
right action we attain the highest development
possible to us at present; we also escape that dreary
sense of disloyal hopeless struggle against circumstances
which is inconsistent with harmony or freedom.
So long as the will of any creature is antagonistic to
the rest of the universe, it is not fully developed.
There must be a harmony among all the parts of a
whole; but in the case of free beings it is not a forced
but a willing harmony that is aimed at; and all
experience takes time</p>

      <div class='line'>Our wills are ours to make them Thine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The higher a man can raise himself in the scale of
existence—by education, right conduct, and persistent
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>effort—the more he may be able to help his fellows.
To some are given ten talents, to some five, and to
another one; but it is the duty of all to use their
talents to the uttermost, so that they may fulfil the
intention of the higher Power which brought us into
existence and intrusted us with responsible control.
Events do not happen without adequate cause, and in
so far as agents, stewards, or trustees rest on their
oars or misuse their opportunities, improvements now
possible will not be accomplished. We must regard
ourselves as instruments and channels of the Divine
action; even in a few things we must be good and
faithful servants, and it is our privilege to help now in
the conscious evolution and development of a higher
life on this planet.</p>

<p class='c013'>The race of man has far to travel before it can be
regarded as an efficient organ of the Divine Purpose.
The extremes of ability and character and virtue
are widely separated; and the occasional elevation
of a leader, here and there, serves but to display
the darkness in which the majority of a race so newly
evolved are still imprisoned; crawling feebly toward
the light, in a state of only rudimentary consciousness;
anxious about trivialities, opposing and hindering
instead of helping each other, competing rather
than co-operating, fighting and struggling and killing
in the throes of racial birth. It is often difficult to
realise the possible perfectness of human life, in the
midst of so much difficulty and discouragement.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>And much of the difficulty is unnecessary and artificial.
Deficiency in the means of subsistence, or in
modest comfort, is not a reasonable condition of human
life. The earth is ready to yield plenty for all, and will
when properly treated and understood; but never
will it spoil its children with bounties from a neglected
breast. It must be coaxed and coerced, and then it
will respond lavishly. We expend plenty of energy
already, only we misapply it. If only our aim could
be changed, and our energy be concentrated on clear
and conscious pressing forward, with a definite mark
in view—towards which all could work together
and all together could attain, instead of one at the
expense of others—“then would the earth put forth
her increase, and God, even our own God, would give
us His blessing.”</p>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 5.  What is meant by good and evil?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> Good is that which promotes development,
and is in harmony with the will of God.
It is akin to health and beauty and happiness.</p>

<p class='c020'>Evil is that which retards or frustrates
development, and injures some part of the
universe. It is akin to disease and ugliness
and misery.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>“Development” means unfolding of latent possibilities;
as a bud unfolds into a flower, or as a chicken
develops from an egg.</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea controlling this answer is that growth
and development are in accordance with the law of
the universe, and that destruction and decay are
features which are only good in so far as they may
be on the way to something better; as leaf-mould
assists the growth of flowers, or as discords in their
proper place conduce to, or prepare for, harmony. In
the same way conditions and practices which once
were good become in process of time corrupt; yet
out of them must grow the better future.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The law of the Universe, and the will of God, are
here regarded as in some sort synonymous terms.
It is impossible properly to define such a term as
“God,” but it is permissible reverently to use the
term for a mode of regarding the Soul of the Universe
as invested with what in human beings we call personality,
consciousness, and other forms of intelligence,
emotion, and will. These attributes, undoubtedly
possessed by a part, are not to be denied to the
whole; however little we may be able as yet to form
a clear conception of their larger meaning.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>It is quite clear that the Universe was not made
by man; it must owe its existence to some higher
Power of which man has but an infinitesimal knowledge.
Some primary conception of such a Power
has been independently formed by every fraction
of the human race, and is what under various
symbols has been called God.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is sometimes asserted that God does not possess
powers and faculties and attributes which we ourselves
possess. But that is preposterous: for though
we may be able to form no conception as to the
particular form our powers would take, when possessed
by a being even moderately higher in the scale of
existence than ourselves; and although vastly more
must be attributed to the Reality denoted by the
term “God” than we can even begin to conceive of;
yet such a term, if it is to have any meaning at all,
must at least include everything we have so far been
able to discover as existent in the Universe. It
must, in fact, be the most comprehensive term that
can be employed; though for practical purposes it
may be permissible to discriminate, and exclude from
its connotation, portions such as “self,” and “the
world,” and sometimes, though with less excuse,
even an abstraction like “nature”; considering these
separately from the more purely personal aspect to
which attention is directed by our ordinary use of the
term God. It is convenient to differentiate the principle
of evil also, and to reserve it for separate study.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>Sometimes the totality of existence is spoken of
as the “Absolute,” and the term God is limited to
the conception of a Being of infinite Goodness and
Mercy, the ultimate Impersonation of Truth and
Love and Beauty; a Being of whose attributes the
highest faculties and perceptions of man are but a
dim shadow or reflexion.</p>

<p class='c013'>In man, goodness is the path toward higher development,
and a radiant beauty is the crown and
perfection of life; so the trinity of Truth, Goodness,
and Beauty, often referred to in literature, may,
without undue stretching, be considered as also
equivalent to what is represented by the words, the
Way, the Truth, and the Life; they are three aspects
of what after all is one essential unity. That which
is good, in the highest sense, cannot help being both
true and beautiful. Nevertheless, for many practical
purposes, these ideas must be discriminated; and the
question is occasionally forced upon our attention
whether vitality or beauty can possibly be enlisted
in the service of evil; and if so, whether it is still
in itself good.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have to learn that most good things can be
misapplied, and that though they do not in themselves
cease to be good, their desecration is especially
deadly. That the corruption of the best abets the
cause of the worst, is proverbial; the prostitution of
high gifts to base ends is the saddest of spectacles.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>Oratory, the power of persuasion, can thus be debased,
and the passions of the multitude may be
incited by the Divine fire of eloquence. Rhetoric
and sophistry have been on this ground condemned
when they were misused for the cultivation of the art
of persuasion apart from knowledge and virtue; but
almost every good gift—personal affection, medical
science, artistic genius—has every now and then been
abused; and the higher and nobler the faculty, the
more sorrowful and diabolical must be its prostitution.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been an ancient puzzle to consider whether
the principle of goodness is the supreme entity in the
universe—a principle to which God as well as man
is subject—or whether it represents only the arbitrary
will of the Creator. Many answers have been given,
but the answer from the side of science is clear:—</p>

<p class='c013'>No existing universe can tend on the whole towards
contraction and decay; because that would foster
annihilation, and so any incipient attempt would not
have survived; consequently an actually existing and
flowing universe must on the whole cherish development,
expansion, growth: and so tend towards
infinity rather than towards zero. The problem is
therefore only a variant of the general problem of
existence. Given existence, of a non-stagnant kind,
and ultimate development must be its law. Good
and evil can be defined in terms of development and
decay respectively. This may be regarded as part of
a revelation of the nature of God.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> His own nature, when uncorrupted by

in general of what is a help or hindrance to
the guiding Spirit, of which he himself is a
real and effective portion.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are not something separate from the Universe,
but a part of it: a part of it endowed with some power
of control—power to guide ourselves and others and
assist in the scheme of development—power also to
go wrong, to set ourselves contrary to the tendency
of things, to delay progress, and break ourselves in
conflict with overpowering forces.</p>

<p class='c013'>When not thus warped or misled, we fit into the
general scheme, and, like all other portions of existence,
can fulfil our function and take our due share
in the general progress. We are a part of the
Universe, and the Universe is a part of God. Even
we also, therefore, have a Divine Nature and may
truly be called sons and co-workers with God. The
consciousness of this constitutes our highest privilege,
and likewise our gravest responsibility. Perception
of this is dawning with increasing brightness on the
human race in the light of the doctrine of evolution.
The process of evolution has no end: progress is
toward an advancing goal. At one time</p>

<p class='c013'>We are essential and active agents in the terrestrial

on their own account; in complete ignorance of the
feelings and perceptions of the larger whole of which
they are microscopic units, towards whose health and
comfort nevertheless they unconsciously but very
really contribute; it is in fact by their activity that
the health of the body is maintained against adverse
influences. So it is with the health of the body
politic, to which our wise activity is necessary and
essential; we are to be a corporate portion of the
whole, effective servants of the guiding and controlling
Spirit. But in our case it is not merely unconscious
service that is called for: we are privileged not only
to be servants, but friends; not only to work, but to
sympathise; to give not only dutiful but affectionate
service. This is required of the humblest, and no
more is required of the noblest:</p>

</div>

<p class='c026'><i>Q. 7.  How comes it that evil exists?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> Evil is not an absolute thing, but has
reference to a standard of attainment. The
possibility of evil is the necessary consequence
of a rise in the scale of moral existence; just
as an organism whose normal temperature is
far above “absolute zero” is necessarily liable
to damaging and deadly cold. But cold is not
in itself a positive or created thing.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
  <h2 class='c022'>CLAUSE VII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The term “evil” is relative: dirt, for instance, is well
known to be only matter out of place; weeds are plants
flourishing where they are not wanted; there are no
weeds in botany, there are weeds in gardening;
even disease is only one organism growing at the
expense of another; ugliness is non-existent save to
creatures with a sense of beauty, and is due to unsuitable
grouping. Analysed into its elements, every
particle of matter must be a miracle of law and order,
and, in that sense, of beauty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Recent discoveries in connexion with the internal
structure of an atom, whereby the constituent particles
are found to move in intricate and ascertainable
orbits—leading to a new science of atomic astronomy—emphasise
this assertion to an extent barely
credible ten years ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even what can be called filth—that is to say
material which, to the casual observer, or when
encountered at unsuitable times, is disgusting—may to
an investigator, or under other circumstances, be of
the highest interest; and may even arouse a sense of
admiration, by reason of manifest subservience to
function.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many social evils are due to human folly and
stupidity, and will cease when the race has risen to a
standard already attained by individuals.</p>

<p class='c013'>Excessive hunger and starvation are manifestly
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>evils of a negative character: they are merely a
deficiency of supply: they have no business to exist
in a civilised and organised community. Famine
and pestilence can be checked by applications of
science.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pain is an awful reality, when highly developed
organisms are subjected to wounds and poison and
disease. Some kinds of pain have been wickedly
inflicted by human beings on each other in the past,
and other kinds may be removed or mitigated by the
progress of discovery in the future. Physiologically
the nerve processes involved are well worthy of study
and control. Premature avoidance of pain would
have been dangerous to the race, and not really
helpful to the individual: but great advances in this
direction are now foreshadowed. Already surgical
operations can be conducted painlessly; and a time is
foreshadowed when, through hypnosis, excessive and
useless torture can be shut off from consciousness,
by intelligence and will; somewhat as the random
leakage of an electric supply can be checked. All
this will come in due time:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The best is yet to be,</div>
      <div class='line'>The last of life for which the first was made:</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Our times are in His hand</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Who saith a whole I planned,</div>
      <div class='line'>Youth shows but half: trust God, see all, nor be afraid.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The contrast between good and evil can be well
illustrated by the contrast between heat and cold.
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>Cold is only the absence of heat, and is made at once
possible and necessary by the existence of degrees of
heat. The fact that we regard excessive cold as an
evil is only because our organisation demands a certain
temperature for life; there is nothing evil about cold
in itself: it is only evil in its relation to organisms
sufficiently high to be damaged by it. The real <i>fact</i>
is their normally high temperature, and their delicacy
of response to stimuli. These things are good; and
the only evil is a defect or deficiency of these good
things.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every rise involves the possibility of fall. Every
advance seems to entail a corresponding penalty.</p>

<p class='c013'>The power of assimilating food leaves the organism
open to the pangs of hunger, that is, of insufficient
nutriment,—manifestly only the absence of a good.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a world devoid of life there is no death; in a
world without conscious beings there is no sin. In a
world without affection there would be no grief; and
to a larger vision much of our grief may be
needless:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My son, the world is dark with griefs and graves,</div>
      <div class='line'>So dark that men cry out against the Heavens.</div>
      <div class='line'>Who knows but that the darkness is in man?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A mechanical universe might be perfectly good.
Every atom of matter perfectly obeys the forces
acting upon it, and there is no error or wickedness
or fault or rebellion in lifeless nature. Evil only
begins when existence takes a higher turn. There
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>is not even destruction or death in the inorganic
world—only transformation. The higher possibility
called life entails the correlative evils called death
and disease. The possibility of keen sensation, which
permits pleasure, also involves capacity for the
corresponding penalty called pain: but the pain is in
ourselves, and is the result of our sensitiveness combined
with imperfection.</p>

<p class='c013'>The still higher attribute of conscious striving
after holiness, which must be the prerogative of free
agents capable of virtue or purposed good, and marks
so enormous a rise in the scale of creation,—involves
the possibility that beings so endowed may fall from
their high level, and, by definitely applying themselves
to harm instead of good, may abuse their high
power and suffer the penalty called sin; but the evil
in all cases is a warped or distorted good, and has
reference to the higher beings which are now in
existence.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There shall never be one lost good! what was shall live as before;</div>
      <div class='line'>The evil is null, is nought, is silence implying sound;</div>
      <div class='line'>What was good shall <i>be</i> good, with, for evil, so much good more;</div>
      <div class='line'>On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven a perfect round.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Some further idea of the necessity for evil can be
conveyed as follows:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Contrast is an inevitable attribute of reality.
Sickness is the negative and opposite of health:
without sickness we should not be aware what health
was. There is no sickness in inorganic nature; yet,
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>even there, contrast is the essence of existence.
Everything that <i>is</i> must be surrounded by regions
where it is not. There is no stupid infinity, or
absence of boundaries, about existing things,—however
infinite their totality may be,—no absence of limitation,
either of perfection or of anything else. Existence
involves limitation. A tree that is <i>here</i> is excluded
from being everywhere else. Goodness would have
no meaning if badness were impossible or non-existent.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“No ill no good! such counter-terms, my son,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We are not machines or automata, but free and
conscious and active agents, and so must contend
with evil as well as rejoice in good. Conflict and
difficulty are essential for our training and development:
even for our existence at this grade. With
their aid we have become what we are; without them
we should vegetate and degenerate; whereas the will
of the Universe is that we arise and walk.</p>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 8.  What is sin?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> Sin is the deliberate and wilful act of a
free agent who sees the better and chooses
the worse, and thereby acts injuriously to
himself and others. The root sin is selfishness,
whereby needless trouble and pain are
inflicted on others; when fully developed it
involves moral suicide.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
  <h2 class='c022'>CLAUSE VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The essence of sin is error against light and knowledge,
and against our own higher nature. Vice is
error against natural law. Crime is error against
society. Sin against our own higher nature may be
truly said to be against God, because it is against
that purpose or destiny which by Divine arrangement
is open to us, if only we will pursue and realise it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sin is a disease: the whole of existence is so bound
together that disease in one part means pain throughout;
the innocent may suffer with the guilty, and
suffering may extend to the Highest. The healing
influences of forgiveness, felt by the broken and the
contrite heart, achieve spiritual reform though they
remove no penalty. Every eddy of conduct, for good
or ill, must have its definite consequence.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have high authority for the statement that
hard circumstances and disabilities, not of our own
making, are mercifully taken into account; while
privileges and advantages weigh heavily in the scale
against us, if we prove unworthy:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>

<p class='c013'>A man’s or woman’s nature may be so weakened
and warped by miserable surroundings, that its
strength is insufficient to cope with its environment.
Pity, and a wish to help, are the feelings which such a
state of things should arouse, together with an active
determination to improve or remove the conditions
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>which lead to such an untoward result. Most human
failures are the result of bad social arrangements, and
they constitute an indictment against human inertness
and selfishness. It is a terrible responsibility to turn
a human soul out of terrestrial life worse than when
it entered that phase of existence. In so far as it
accomplishes that, humanity is performing the
function of a devil. Deterioration of others is usually
achieved under the influence of some of the protean
forms of social greed and selfishness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another reason why selfishness is spoken of as specially
deadly, and even suicidal, depends upon certain
regions of scientific inquiry not yet incorporated into
orthodox science and therefore still to be regarded
as speculative; it may be outlined as follows:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Our present familiar methods of communicating
with each other are such as speech, writing, and other
conventional codes of signs more or less developed.
It appears possible that a germ or nucleus of another,
apparently immediate or directly psychical, method
of communication may also exist; which has nothing
to do with our known bodily organs, although its
impressions are apprehended or interpreted by the
receiver as if they were due to customary modes or
forms of sensation. Whether that be so or not, it is
certain that bodily neighbourhood and blood relationship
confer opportunities for making friends which
should be utilised to the utmost, and that friendship
and affection are the most important things in life.</p>

<p class='c013'>The intercourse with, and active assistance of, others
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>enlarges our own nature; and hereafter, when we have
lost our bodily organs, it is probable that we shall be
able to communicate only with those with whom we
are connected by links of sympathy and affection.</p>

<p class='c013'>A person who cuts himself off from all human
intercourse and lives a miserly self-centred life,
will ultimately, therefore, find himself alone in the
universe; and, unless taken pity on and helped in
a spirit of self-sacrifice, may as well be out of
existence altogether. (A book called <i>Cecilia de
Noel</i> emphasises this truth under the guise of a
story.) That is why developed selfishness is spoken
of as moral suicide: it is one of those evil things
which truly assault and hurt the soul. It is a
disintegrating and repelling agency. Love is the
linking and uniting force in the spiritual universe,
enabling it to cohere into a unity, in analogy with
attractive forces in the material cosmos.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been necessary to dwell on the sin and pain
and sorrow in the world, but the amount of good
must be emphatically recognised too.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our highest aspirations, and longings for something
better, are a sign that better things exist. It is not
given to the creature to exceed the Creator in
imagination or in goodness; and the best and highest
we can imagine shall be more than fulfilled by
reality—in due time:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 9.  Are there beings lower in the scale of
existence than man?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> Yes, multitudes. In every part of the
earth where life is possible, there we find it
developed. Life exists in every variety of
animal, in earth and air and sea, and in every
species of plant.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
  <h2 class='c022'>CLAUSE IX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>One of the facts of nature which we must weld into
our conception of the scheme of the universe, is the
strenuous effort made by all live things to persist
in multifarious ways,—spreading out into quite
unlikely regions, in the struggle for existence, and
establishing themselves wherever life is possible. The
fish slowly developing into a land animal, the reptile
beginning to raise itself in the air and ultimately
becoming a bird, the mammal returning under stress
of circumstances to the water, as a seal or whale, or
betaking itself to the air in search of food, in the form
of a bat,—all these are instances of a universal
tendency throughout animate nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sometimes this determined effort at persistence
breeds forms that appear to us ugly and deleterious.
For the struggle results not only in beneficent
organisms, but also in parasites and pests and blights,
and may be held to account for the numerous cases
of the interference of one form of life with another:
one form utilising another for its own growth, and
sometimes destroying that other in the process. It
accounts also for the ravages of disease, which for the
most part is an outcome of the establishment of a
foreign and alien growth in a living body of higher
grade,—a growth whose vital secretions are poisonous
to its temporary host. On the other hand, the theory
of manuring, the purification of rivers, the treatment
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>of sewage, the use of opsonins and of serum-injections,—all
illustrate the ministration of one form
of life to another; they exhibit the contribution of
beneficent organisms,—that is, of forms of life which
promote higher development and conduce to well-being.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many of the microbes and bacteria and low forms
of cell life are beneficent in this way; and it is our
function,—as ourselves one of the forms of life,—now
consciously to intervene and take control of
these vital processes. By investigation and study
we can gradually understand the condition and life-history
of each organism, and then can take such
measures as will encourage the beneficent forms
whether plant or animal, and destroy or eliminate
those which from the human point of view are deadly
and destructive,—attacking them at their weakest and
most vulnerable stage. Widely regarded or interpreted,
this function covers an immense range of
possible activity—from every kind of scientific
agriculture and the extirpating of tropical diseases, to
the reformation of slum dwellings and the encouragement
of physical training and school hygiene. As
part of our work in regulating this planet and
utilising its possibilities to the utmost for higher
purposes, the regulation of vital conditions is probably
our most pressing, and also at present our most
neglected, corporate duty. Stupidity and a mistaken
parsimony are among the serious obstacles with
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>which the progressive portions of humanity have
to contend.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another aspect of the universal struggle for self-manifestation
and corporeal realisation, which plays
so large a part in all activity and is especially marked
in the domain of life, is illustrated on a higher level
by that overpowering instinct or impulse towards
production and self-realisation, which is characteristic
of genius. It may be said that throughout nature,
from the lowest to the highest, a tendency to self-realisation,
and a manifestation of joy in existence,
are conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is thought that something akin to this tendency
is exhibited in a region beyond and above what is
ordinarily conceived of as “Nature.” The process of
evolution can be regarded as the gradual unfolding
of the Divine Thought, or <i>Logos</i>, throughout the
universe, by the action of Spirit upon matter.
Achievement seems as if irradiated by a certain
Happiness: and thus a poet like Browning is led to
speak of the Divine Being as renewing his ancient
creative rapture in the processes of nature:—joying
in the sunbeams basking upon sand, sharing the
pleasures of the wild life in the creatures of the woods,</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 10.  Are there any beings higher in the
scale of existence than man?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> Man is the highest of the dwellers on the
planet earth, but the earth is only one of many
planets warmed by the sun, and the sun is only
one of a myriad of similar suns, which are so
far off that we barely see them, and group them
indiscriminately as “stars.” We may reasonably
conjecture that in some of the innumerable
worlds circling round those distant suns there
must be beings far higher in the scale of existence
than ourselves; indeed, we have no
knowledge which enables us to assert the
absence of intelligence anywhere.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
  <h2 class='c022'>CLAUSE X</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The existence of higher beings and of a Highest
Being is a fundamental element in every religious
creed. There is no scientific reason for imagining
it possible that man is the highest intelligent existence—there
is no reason to suppose that we dwellers
on this planet know more about the universe than
any other existing creature. Such an idea, strictly
speaking, is absurd. Science has investigated our
ancestry and shown that we are the product of
planetary processes. We may be, and surely must
be, something more, but this we clearly are—a
development of life on this planet earth. Science
has also revealed to us an innumerable host of other
worlds, and has relegated the earth to its now recognised
subordinate place as one of a countless
multitude of worlds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Consider a spherical region bounded by the
distance of the farthermost stars visible in the
strongest telescope, or say with a radius corresponding
to a parallax of one-thousandth of a
second of arc, so that the time taken by light to
travel right across it is 6000 years:—Lord Kelvin,
treating of such a portion of Universe, says:</p>

<p class='c013'>“There may also be a large amount of matter in
many stars outside the sphere of 3×10<sup>16</sup><a id='tn073'></a> kilometres
radius, but however much matter there may be
outside it, it seems to be made highly probable, by
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>§§ 11-21, that the total quantity of matter within
it is greater than 100 million times, and less than
2000 million times, the sun’s mass” (<i>Philosophical
Magazine</i>, August 1901).</p>

<p class='c013'>It does not follow that all this matter is distributed
in masses like our sun with its attendant
planets; but, on the average, that is as likely an
arrangement as another, and it corresponds with
what we know.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, given, on this hypothesis, the existence of
some thousand million solar systems or families of
worlds, within our ken, and knowing what we do
about the exuberant impulse towards vital development
wherever it is possible, we must conclude that
those worlds contain life; and if so, it is against all
reasonable probability that the only world of which
we happen to know the details contains the creature
highest in the entire scale. It would be just as
reasonable to imagine, what we happen to know is
false, that our particular sun is the largest, and our
particular planet the brightest of all, as it is to conjecture
that this world is the highest and best, or the
only one in existence.</p>

<p class='c013'>The self-glorifying instinct of the human mind
has resented this negative conclusion, and for long
clung to the Ptolemaic idea that the earth was no
mere planet among a crowd of others, but was the
centre of the universe; and that the sun and all
the stars were subsidiary to it. A Ptolemaic idea
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>clings to some of us still—not now as regards the
planet, but as regards man; and we, insignificant
creatures, with senses only just open to the portentous
meaning of the starry sky, presume—some of us—to
deny the existence of higher powers and higher
knowledge than our own. We are accustomed to
be careful as to what we assert; we are liable to
be unscrupulous as to what we deny. It is possible
to find people who, knowing nothing or next to
nothing of the Universe, are prepared to limit existence
to that of which they have had experience,
and to measure the cosmos in terms of their own
understanding. Their confidence in themselves, their
shut minds and self-satisfied hearts, are things to
marvel at. The fact is that no glimmer of a conception
of the real magnitude and complexity of existence
can ever have illuminated their cosmic view.</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 11.  What caused and what maintains
existence?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> Of our own knowledge we are unable
to realise the meaning of origination or of
maintenance; all that we ourselves can accomplish
in the physical world is to move things
into desired positions, and leave them to act
on each other. Nevertheless our effective movements
are all inspired by thought, and so we
conceive that there must be some Intelligence
immanent in all the processes of nature, for
they are not random or purposeless, but organised
and beautiful.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c022'>CLAUSE XI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Origin</span></p>

<p class='c013'>We cannot conceive the origin of any fundamental
existence. We can describe the beginning of any
particular object in its present shape, but its substance
always existed in some other shape previously;
and nothing really either springs into being or ceases
to exist. A cloud or dew becomes visible, and then
evaporates, seeming to spring into being and then
vanish away; but as water vapour it had a past
history and will have a future, both apparently
without limit. In our own case, and in the case of
any live thing, the history is unknown to us; but
ultimate origin or absolute beginning, save of individual
collocations, is unthinkable.</p>

<p class='c013'>The truth that science teaches, on the one hand,
is that everything is a perpetual flux,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>πάντα ῥεὶ ϰαὶ οὐδὲν μένει,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>that nothing is permanent and fixed and unchangeable:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The hills are shadows, and they flow</div>
      <div class='line'>From form to form, and nothing stands;</div>
      <div class='line'>They melt like mists, the solid lands,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like clouds they shape themselves and go.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, we learn that, in its ultimate
essence and reality, everything is persistent and
eternal; that it is the form alone that changes, while
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>the substance endures. No end and no beginning—a
continual Eternal Now—this is the scientific interpretation
of I AM.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are those who think that in the last resort
the ultimate reality will be found to be of the nature
of Spirit, Consciousness, and Mind. It may be so—it
probably is so—but that is a teaching of Philosophy,
not at present of Science.</p>

<p class='c013'>The teaching of religion may be summarised thus:</p>

<p class='c013'>“All that exists, exists only by the communication
of God’s infinite being. All that has intelligence,
has it only by derivation from His sovereign reason;
and all that acts, acts only from the impulse of His
supreme activity. It is He who does all in all; it
is He who, at each instant of our life, is the beating
of our heart, the movement of our limbs, the light
of our eyes, the intelligence of our spirit, the soul of
our soul.”—<i>Fénelon.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Maintenance</span></p>

<p class='c013'>So also with regard to maintenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>The multifarious processes around us—the succession
of the seasons, the flow of sap in trees, the
circulation of our own blood, the digestion of our
food—all these things are beyond our power, and
are not contrived or managed by our conscious
agency—not even the occurrences in our own bodies.
But by means of such unconscious processes our
muscular and nervous systems are supplied with
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>nutriment, and we thus become master of a certain
amount of energy.</p>

<p class='c013'>The energy of our muscles, or of some of them,
is within our control, and we can thereby direct
other physical energies into desired channels; but
we cannot in the slightest degree alter the amount
of that energy. We utilise terrestrial energy, by
directing and controlling its transformations and
transferences, within the limits of our knowledge;
but we do it always by moving material objects,
and in no other way. For instance, we cannot
directly or consciously generate an electric current,
or magnetism, or light, or life; for all these things
we depend upon partially explored properties of
matter, which we can arrange in a certain way so
as to achieve a desired end.</p>

<p class='c013'>A multitude of complex processes are constantly
occurring in our bodies without any intervention of
consciousness; and though we may make a study
of the functions of the several organs, and gradually
learn something about them, it is a study as of something
outside ourselves; the due performance of
bodily function is independent of our volition. We
can interfere with and damage our organs, and with
skill we can so arrange damaged parts that the self-healing
process shall have time and opportunity to
act; we can also introduce beneficent agencies and
stimulating drugs; but our power of direct action is
practically limited to muscular and mental activity.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span><i>Digression on Rudimentary Physiology</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is well for children to have some conception of
the complex processes constantly occurring in their
own organisms.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fact that the heart is a continuously acting
pump, urging the blood along arteries to the tissues,—to
places where it picks up nutriment, to places
where the crudely enriched blood is oxidised, to
places where the elaborated material is deposited
so as to replenish waste and effect growth—all this
should be known; and the partial analogy with the
sap of trees, rising in the trunk to be elaborated in
the leaves by means of sunshine and air, and then
descending ready to be deposited as liquid wood,
can be pointed out.</p>

<p class='c013'>The function of the lungs, wherein the blood dispersed
throughout a spongy texture is exposed in
immense surface to the air, without loss or leakage
other than what properly transpires through the
membranes, and the consequent advantage of deep
breathing and of fresh clean air,—all this has a
practical as well as a theoretical interest.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lungs are more under voluntary control than
the heart, but the way exercise increases the circulation,
and generally blows the fires of the body, is
also of practical interest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some idea of the processes of digestion can be
given, especially the function of the stomach and the
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>intestines; the liver may be too difficult, but the
salivary glands are fairly simple, and so are the
kidneys and the skin. The way the muscles act as
an efficient mechanical engine, depending on the
consumption of fuel and the conservation of energy,
can be superficially explained, with some idea of
the stimulating nervous system and controlling brain
cells. The sensory nerves and specialised nerve-endings
demand specific treatment.</p>

<p class='c013'>These and other physiological details may seem
out of place, but they are strictly appropriate; for the
essence of Immanence is that nothing is common
or unclean, until abused: and the nobler the faculty,
the fouler is the degradation caused by its abuse.
A sense of the responsibility involved in the possession
or lease of all this intricate mass of mechanism,
intrusted to our care, and the wish to keep it in
good order—without giving unnecessary trouble to
others to set it right, and without blaspheming the
Maker by applying it to bad and ignoble ends—will
arise almost imperceptibly, when the body is
even begun to be understood. Many faults originate
in ignorance and want of thought.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mind and Matter</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Among the material objects we move are the
parts of our own bodies; indeed, it is through
muscular intervention or agency that we act on
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>bodies in general. We know of no other method.
Even when we <i>speak</i> we are only moving certain
face and throat and chest muscles, so as to
generate condensations and rarefactions in the air;
which, travelling by dynamical properties, excite
corresponding vibrations or movements in the ear
drum of our auditor;—vibrations not in themselves
intelligible, but demanding interpretation from the
recipient. So also it is with the traces of ink left on
paper by our muscular action when we write. Only
to a perceptive eye, and informed and kindred mind,
have they any meaning.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is probable that even when we think, some
special atomic motion goes on in the brain cells,
though this is an example of <i>unconscious</i> movement,
of which there are many examples in bodily function;
but directly we begin to attend to mental processes
we leave the physical region as understood by us,
and enter a more deeply mysterious psychical
region. Unknown as this is for purposes of analysis,
from the point of view of experience it is more
immediately familiar than any other; since it is
through the activity of mind that every other kind
of existence is necessarily inferred. Thought is our
mechanism or instrument of knowledge—through it
we know everything—but thought is not what we
directly know. Primarily we think of <i>things</i>, not of
thought itself. So also sight is our instrument of
seeing—through light we see—but it is not light
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>that we perceive, rather it is the objects which send
it in certain patterns to our eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whereas we can act on the external world only
through our muscles; in ourselves we are aware of
things belonging to a totally different category, with
which muscle and movement and energy appear to
have nothing to do,—such things as thought, purpose,
desire, humour, affection, consciousness, will. These
mental faculties seem intimately associated with, and
are displayed by, our bodily mechanism; but in themselves
they belong to a different order of being,—an
order which employs and dominates the material,
while immersed or immanent in it. Every purposed
movement is preceded and inspired by thought.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such reasoned control, by indwelling mind, may
be undetectable and inconceivable to a low order of
intelligence, being totally masked by the material
garment; and the purpose underlying our activity
may have to be inferred, by such intelligence, with
as great difficulty as we feel in detecting indwelling
Purpose amid the spontaneous operations of
Nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nevertheless, whenever our movements are not controlled
by thought and intelligent purpose, but are
left to chance and random impulses, like the actions
of a man whose reason has been unseated, nothing
but error and confusion results;—quite a different
state of things from anything we observe in the
orderly and beautiful procedure of nature.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>It is sometimes said that the operations of nature
are spontaneous; and that is exactly what they are.
That is the meaning of immanence. “Spontaneous,”
used in this sense, does not mean random and purposeless
and undetermined: it means actuated and controlled
from within, by something indwelling and all
pervading and not absent anywhere. The intelligence
which guides things is not something external
to the scheme, clumsily interfering with it by muscular
action, as we are constrained to do when we interfere
at all; but is something within and inseparable from
it, as human thought is within and inseparable from
the action of our brains.</p>

<p class='c013'>In some partially similar way we conceive that the
multifarious processes in nature, with neither the origin
nor maintenance of which have we had anything to do,
must be guided and controlled by some Thought and
Purpose, immanent in everything, but revealed only
to those with sufficiently awakened perceptions.
Many are blind to the meaning—to the fact even
that there is a meaning—in nature; just as an animal
is usually blind to a picture, and always to a poem;
but to the higher members of our race the Intelligence
and Purpose, underlying the whole mystery of existence,
elaborating the details of evolution—and ultimately
tending to elucidate the frequent discords,
the strange humours, and puzzling contradictions of
life—are keenly felt. To them the lavish beauty of
wild Nature—of landscape, of sunset, of mountain,
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>and of sea—are revelations of an indwelling Presence,
rejoicing in its own majestic order.</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea that the world as we know it arose by
chance and fortuitous concourse of atoms is one that
no science really sustains, though such an idea is the
superficial outcome of an incipient recognition of the
uniformity of nature—a sequel to the perception that
there is no capricious or spasmodic interference with
the course of events, and no changes of purpose
observable therein, such as we are accustomed to
in works of human ingenuity and skill. We are
accustomed to associate “will” with the degenerate
form of it called caprice, and to consider that “purpose”
must be accompanied by changes of purpose; so
that a steady, uniform, persistent course of action is
puzzling to us, and wears the superficial aspect of
mechanism. An omnipresent, uniform, immanent
Purpose, running through the whole of existence
without break of continuity or change of aim, is
beyond our experience; and, like every other uniformity,
is difficult to detect or realise. As an
instance of this difficulty, I need only cite the long-delayed
discovery of an all-embracing medium-like
the terrestrial atmosphere. An intelligent deep-sea
creature would find it most difficult to become aware
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>of the existence of water. Similarly humanity has
existed all along in a pervading and interpenetrating
ether, of which to this day men have for the most
part no cognisance; although it is probably the
fundamental substratum of the whole material world,
underlying every kind of activity, and constituting
the very atoms of which their own bodies are
composed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Looking at the truths of geometry, the laws of
nature, and the beauty and organisation of the visible
world, it is as impossible rationally to suppose that
they arose by chance, or by mere contentious jostling,
as it is to suppose that a work of literature or a piece
of music was composed in that way.</p>

<p class='c013'>The process of evolution appears to us self-sustained
and self-guided, because the guidance is uniform and
constant.</p>

<p class='c013'>In nature, heredity and survival will explain the
persistence of a favourable variation when once
originated, but the origin of variations is still
mysterious, and the full meaning of heredity is
not yet unravelled.</p>

<p class='c013'>The struggle for existence has been one of the
means whereby animal life has been developed and
perfected; but now that it has become conscious
and purposeful, in humanity, the apparently blind
struggle is suspended at the higher level, and the
weak and suffering are attended to and helped—not
exterminated. There must always be disciplinary
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>effort: but it can be effort for something better than
bare subsistence; it can conduce to evolution of character,
and development of soul. Mere struggle and
survival is an inferior instrument of progress, and it
can be superseded wherever it has done its necessary
preliminary work. The Divine purpose is fulfilled in
many ways; and far more can be expected of self-conscious
evolution than of the long slow process
which has rendered it possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>The kind of selection actually or best known to us
is that which has been directed by human beings;
and inasmuch as the highest human beings are
themselves conscious of help and guidance, it is to
be assumed that such help and guidance has been
in constant activity all along, operating on, or rather
in, the refractory materials, so as slowly to develop
in them the power of manifesting not only life and
beauty, but also consciousness, spiritual perception,
and free will.</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 12.  What is to be said of man’s higher
faculties?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> The faculties and achievements of the
highest among mankind—in Art, in Science, in
Philosophy, and in Religion—are not explicable
as an outcome of a struggle for existence.
Something more than mere life is possessed
by us—something represented by the words
“mind” and “soul” and “spirit.” On one
side we are members of the animal kingdom;
on another we are associates in a loftier type
of existence, and are linked with the Divine.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
  <h2 class='c022'>CLAUSE XII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The highest of those who have walked the earth
reveal to us what we, too, may some day be: they link
us with the Divine, and teach us that, however pathetically
defaced by our infirmities and distorted by our
imperfections, we may yet reflect the image of God.</p>

<p class='c013'>[<i>Part of the following explanation is based upon a
study of certain facts not yet fully incorporated into
orthodox science, nor fully recognised by philosophy:
it must therefore be regarded as speculation.</i>]</p>

<p class='c013'>This idea, which permeates literature—that man
has a spiritual as well as a material origin—emphasises
from another point of view the doctrine
of the Fall. For the utilisation of a material body,
of animal ancestry, exposes the individual to much
trial and temptation, and makes him aware of a
contest between the flesh and the spirit, or between
a lower and a higher self, which constitutes the
element of truth in the otherwise mistaken doctrine
of “original,” or inherited, or imputed sin. Vicarious
sin is a legal fiction: so is vicarious punishment;
vicarious suffering is a reality. The mother of a
ne’er-do-well knows it: it is undergone by the
children of vicious parents; the highest souls have
felt it on behalf of the race of man; but it is not
artificial or imputed suffering, it is genuine and real; and
experience shows that it can have a redeeming virtue.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>The double nature of man,—the inherited animal
tendencies, and the inspired spiritual aspirations,
if they can both be fully admitted, reconcile many
difficulties. Our body is an individual collocation of
cells, which began to form and grow together at a
certain date, and will presently be dispersed; but the
constructing and dominating reality, called our “soul,”
did not then begin to exist; nor will it cease with
bodily decay. Interaction with the material world
then began, and will then cease, but we ourselves in
essence are persistent and immortal. Even our personality
and individuality may be persistent, if our
character be sufficiently developed to possess a reality
of its own. In our present state, truly, the memory
of our past is imperfect or non-existent; but when
we waken and shake off the tenement of matter,
our memory and consciousness may enlarge too, as
we rejoin the larger self of which only a part is now
manifested in mortal flesh.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ancient doctrine of a previous state of
existence, of which we are now entranced into forgetfulness,
is inculcated in the familiar lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Soul that rises with us, our life’s star,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Hath had elsewhere its setting,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And cometh from afar:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Not in entire forgetfulness,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And not in utter nakedness,</div>
      <div class='line'>But trailing clouds of glory do we come</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From God, who is our home,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>the idea being that the forgetfulness is not complete,
especially during infancy; nor need it be complete
in moments of inspiration. Myers’ doctrine of the
subliminal self is an expanded and modified form
of this idea, and is to a large extent apparently
justified by a certain range of psychological inquiry:
though Myers lays stress, not on memory of a past,
but on a present occasional intercommunication
between the part and the whole.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Platonic doctrine of reminiscence exhibits one
variety of the idea of pre-existence, though in a necessarily
inaccurate and somewhat fanciful form—as
though infants were a stage higher in the scale than
grown men. Such an idea would involve the old
mistaken postulate of initial perfection, which was
made long ago concerning the race: whereas the
truth was innocency, not perfection. But the idea
that nothing less than the whole of a personality must
be incarnated—even in the body of an infant—leads
to innumerable difficulties;—it does not even escape
unanswerable questions about trivialities such as the
moment of arrival; and it is responsible for much
biological scepticism concerning the existence of any
soul at all. Whereas, on the strength of the experience
that all processes in nature are really
gradual, the idea of gradual incarnation—increasing
as the brain and body grow, but never attaining
any approach to completeness even in the greatest
of men—sets one above innumerable petty difficulties,
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>and to me seems an opening in the direction of the
truth. On this view, the portion of larger self
incarnated in an infant or a feeble-minded person
is but small: in normal cases, more appears as the
body is fitted to receive it. In some cases much
appears, thus constituting a great man; while in
others, again, a link of occasional communication is
left open between the part and the whole—producing
what we call “genius.” Second childishness is the
gradual abandonment of the material vehicle, as it
gets worn out or damaged. But, during the episode
of this life, man is never a complete self, his roots
are in another order of being, he is moving about
in worlds not realised, he is as if walking in a vain
shadow and disquieting himself in vain.</p>

<p class='c013'>It may be objected that our present existence is
very far from being a dream or trance-like condition,
that we are very wide awake to the “realities” of the
world, and very keen about “things of importance”;
that an analogy drawn from the memories of
hypnotic patients and multiple personalities, and
other pathological cases, is sure to be misleading.
It may be so, the idea is admittedly of the nature
of speculation; but the greatest of poets lends his
countenance to the notion that phenomena and
appearances are not ultimate realities, that our present
life is not unlike the state of a sleep-walker—that
we slept to enter it, and must sleep again
before we wake—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>“We are such stuff</div>
      <div class='line'>As dreams are made of, and our little life</div>
      <div class='line'>Is rounded with a sleep.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>As to the question whether we ever again live on
earth, it appears unlikely on this view that a given
developed individual will appear again in unmodified
form. If my present self is a fraction of a larger
self, some other fraction of that larger self may readily
be thought of as appearing,—to gain practical experience
in the world of matter, and to return with
developed character to the whole whence it sprang.
And this operation may be repeated frequently;
but these hypothetical fractional appearances can
hardly be spoken of as reincarnations. We must
not dogmatise, however, on the subject, and the case
of the multitudes at present thwarted and returned
at infancy may demand separate treatment. It may
be that the abortive attempts at development on
the part of individuals are like the waves lapping up
the sides of a boulder and being successively flung
back; while the general advance of the race is
typified by the steady rising of the tide.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Soul and Body</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The philosophic doctrine of the “self” on this view
is a difficult one, and involves much study. As here
stated, the form is sure to be crude and imperfect.
Philosophy resents any sharp distinction between soul
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>and body, between indwelling self and material
vehicle. It prefers to treat the self as a whole, an
individual unit; though it may admit the actual
agglomeration of material particles to be transient
and temporary. The word “self” can be used in a
narrower or in a broader sense. It may signify the
actual continuity of personality and memory whereof
we are conscious; or it may signify a larger and
vaguer underlying reality, of which the conscious
self is but a fraction. The narrower sense is wide
enough to include the whole man, both soul and
body, as we know him; but the phrase “subliminal
self” covers ideas extending hypothetically beyond
that.</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea of Redemption or Regeneration, in its
highest and most Christian form, is applicable to
both soul and body. The life of Christ shows us
that the whole man can be regenerated as he stands;
that we have not to wait for a future state, that the
Kingdom of Heaven is in our midst and may be
assimilated by us here and now.</p>

<p class='c013'>The term “salvation” should not be limited to the
soul, but should apply to the whole man. What
kind of transfiguration may be possible, <i>or may
have been possible</i>, in the case of a perfectly emancipated
and glorified body, we do not yet know.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a still larger sense these terms apply to the
whole race of man; and for the salvation of mankind
individual loss and suffering have been gladly
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>expended. Not the individual alone, but the race
also, can be adjured to realise some worthy object
for all its striving, to open its eyes to more glorious
possibilities than it has yet perceived, to</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 13.  Is man helped in his struggle upward?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> There is a Power in the Universe vastly
beyond our comprehension; and we trust and
believe that it is a Good and Loving Power,
able and willing to help us and all creatures,
and to guide us wisely, without detriment to
our incipient freedom. This Loving-kindness
continually surrounds us; in it we live and
have our real being; it is the mainspring of
joy and love and beauty, and we call it the
Grace of God. It sustains and enriches all
worlds, and may take a multiplicity of forms,
but it was specially manifested to dwellers on
this planet in the life of Jesus Christ, through
whose spirit and living influence the race of
man may hope to rise to heights at present
inaccessible.</p>

  <h2 class='c022'>CLAUSE XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The guidance exercised by the Divine Spirit, by
which we are completely surrounded, is not of the
nature of compulsion; it is only a leading and helping
influence, which we are able to resist if we choose.</p>

<p class='c013'>The problem of manufacturing free creatures with
a will of their own, to be led, not forced, into right
action, is a problem of a different nature from any of
those that have ever appealed to human power and
knowledge. What we are accustomed to make is
mechanism, of various kinds; and the essential
difficulty of the higher problem is so obscure to us
that some impatient and unimaginative persons cry
out against its slowness, and wonder that everything
is not compulsorily made perfect at once. But we
can see that the kind of perfection thus easily attainable
would be of an utterly inferior kind.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is to be supposed that incarnation, or a
connexion between consciousness and material
mechanism, is auxiliary to the difficult process of
evolution of free beings, thus indicated; and it is
probable that matter is thus an instrument of lofty
spiritual purpose. Some religious systems have failed
to perceive this, and have depreciated matter and
flesh as intrinsically evil.</p>

<p class='c013'>One important feature of Christianity is that it
recognises as good the connexion between spirit and
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>matter, and emphasises the importance of both, when
properly regarded. It is not mystical and spiritual
alone, nor is it material alone; but it tends to unify
these two extremes, and to place in due position both
soul and body: the material being utilised to make
manifest the spiritual, and being dominated by it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The whole idea of the Incarnation, as well as some
of the miracles and the sacraments, are expressive of
this wide and comprehensive character of the Christian
religion.</p>

<p class='c013'>It recognises the wonder and beauty of the animal
body, destined to be the scene of extraordinary
spiritual triumphs in the long course of time; and it
teaches</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That none but Gods could build this house of ours,</div>
      <div class='line'>So beautiful, vast, various, so beyond</div>
      <div class='line'>All work of man, yet, like all work of man,</div>
      <div class='line'>A beauty with defect—till That which knows,</div>
      <div class='line'>And is not known, but felt thro’ what we feel</div>
      <div class='line'>Within ourselves is highest, shall descend</div>
      <div class='line'>On this half-deed, and shape it at the last</div>
      <div class='line'>According to the Highest in the Highest.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Christianity is a planetary and human religion:
being the revelation of those aspects of Godhead
which are most intelligible and helpful to us in our
present stage of development. But it is more than a
revelation, it is a manifestation of some of the attributes
of Godhead in the form of humanity.</p>

<p class='c013'>The statement that Christ and God are one, is not
really a statement concerning Christ, but a statement
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>concerning what we understand by God. It is useless,
and in the literal sense preposterous, to explain the
known in terms of the unknown: the converse is the
right method. “He that hath seen me hath seen the
Father.” Every son of man is potentially also a son
of God, but the union was deepest and completest in
the Galilean.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ideas of incarnation and revelation are not
confined to the domain of religion; they are common
to music and letters and science: in all we recognise
“a flash of the will that can,”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All through my keys that gave their sounds to a wish of my soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>All through my soul that praised, as the wish flowed visibly forth.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The spirit of Beethoven is incarnate in his music;
and he that hath heard the Fifth Symphony hath
heard Beethoven.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Incarnation of the Divine Spirit in man is the
central feature of Terrestrial History. It is through
man, and the highest man, that the revelation of what
is meant by Godhead must necessarily come. The
world—even the common everyday world—has
accepted this, and is able to perceive its appropriateness
and truth; and the traditional song of the angels,
at the epoch of the Birth—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>“Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace, goodwill among men,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>is still heard in the land. Whenever there is war at
Christmas-time it is universally felt to be incongruous.
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>Goodwill among men is conspicuous in cessation of
private feuds, in overladen postbags, in family reunions
and Christmas hampers and all manner of
homely frivolities.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Incarnation doctrine is the glorification of
human effort, and the sanctification of childhood and
simplicity of life; but it is a pity to reduce it to a
dogma. It is well to leave something to intuitive
apprehension, and to let the life and death of Christ
gradually teach their own eloquent lesson without
premature dogmatic assistance.</p>

<p class='c013'>From that event we date our history, and the
strongest believer in immanent Godhead can admit
that the life of Jesus was an explicit and clear-voiced
message of love to this planet from the Father of all.
Naturally our conception of Godhead is still only indistinct
and partial, but, so far as we are as yet able
to grasp it, we must reach it through recognition of
the extent and intricacy of the Cosmos, and more
particularly through the highest type and loftiest
spiritual development of man himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most essential element in Christianity is its
conception of a human God; of a God, in the first
place, not apart from the Universe, not outside it and
distinct from it, but immanent in it; yet not immanent
only, but actually incarnate, incarnate in it and
revealed in the Incarnation. The nature of God is
displayed in part by everything, to those who have
eyes to see, but is displayed most clearly and fully
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>by the highest type of existence, the highest experience
to which the process of evolution has so far
opened our senses.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“’Tis the sublime of man,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our noontide majesty, to know ourselves</div>
      <div class='line'>Part and proportion of one wondrous whole.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The Humanity of God, the Divinity of man, is the
essence of the Christian revelation. It was truly a
manifestation of Immanuel.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Christian idea of God is not that of a being
outside the universe, above its struggles and advances,
looking on and taking no part in the process, <i>solely</i>
exalted, beneficent, self-determined, and complete.
It is also that of a God who loves, who yearns,
who suffers, who keenly laments the rebellious and
misguided activity of the free agents brought into
being by Himself as part of Himself, who enters
into the storm and conflict, and is subject to
conditions as the soul of it all.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is the truth which has been reverberating down
the ages ever since; it has been the hidden inspiration
of saint, apostle, prophet, martyr, and, in however dim
and vague a form, has given hope and consolation to
the unlettered and poverty-stricken millions:—A God
that could understand, that could suffer, that could
sympathise, that had felt the extremity of human
anguish, the agony of bereavement, had submitted
even to the brutal hopeless torture of the innocent,
and had become acquainted with the pangs of
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>death—this has been the chief consolation of the
Christian religion. This is the extraordinary conception
of Godhead to which we have thus far risen.
“This is My beloved Son.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Enough that he heard it once; we shall hear it
by and by.” The Christian God is revealed as the
incarnate Spirit of humanity; or rather the incarnate
spirit of humanity is recognised as a real intrinsic
part of God. “The Kingdom of Heaven is within
you.”</p>

things too high for our own knowledge?</i></p>

to interpret their inspired writings.</p>

<p class='c009'>People at a low stage of development are liable to
think that they can arrive at truth by their unaided
judgment and insight, and that they need not concern
themselves with the thoughts and experiences of the
past. Unconscious of any inspiration themselves,
they decline to believe in the possibility of such a
thing, and regard it as a fanciful notion of unpractical
and dreamy people.</p>

<p class='c013'>Great men, on the other hand, are the fingerposts
and lodestars of humanity; it is with their aid that
we steer our course, if we are wise, and the records of
their thought and inspiration are of the utmost value
to us.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is the meaning of literature in general, and of
that mass of ancient religious literature in particular,
on which hundreds of scholars have bestowed their
best energies: now translated, bound together, and
handed down to us as the Canon of Scripture, of
which some portions are the most inspired writings
yet achieved by humanity. It is impossible for us to
ignore the concurrent mass of human testimony
therein recorded, the substantial and general truth of
which has been vouched for by the prophets and
poets and seers of all time. Accordingly, if we
are to form worthy beliefs regarding the highest
conceptions in the Universe, we must avail ourselves
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>of all this testimony; discriminating and estimating
its relative value in the light of our own judgment
and experience, studying such works and criticism as
are accessible to us, asking for the guidance of the
Divine Spirit, and seeking with modest and careful
patience to apprehend something in the direction of
the truth.</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 15.  What, then, do you reverently believe
can be deduced from a study of the records and
traditions of the past in the light of the present?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> I believe in one Infinite and Eternal
Being, a guiding and loving Father, in whom
all things consist.</p>

<p class='c020'>I believe that the Divine Nature is specially
revealed to man through Jesus Christ our Lord,
who lived and taught and suffered in Palestine
1900 years ago, and has since been worshipped
by the Christian Church as the immortal Son
of God, the Saviour of the world.</p>

<p class='c020'>I believe that the Holy Spirit is ever ready
to help us along the Way towards Goodness
and Truth; that prayer is a means of
communion between man and God; and that
it is our privilege through faithful service to
enter into the Life Eternal, the Communion of
Saints, and the Peace of God.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Notes on the Creed</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The three paragraphs correspond to the three
aspects or Personifications of Deity which have most
impressed mankind,—
  The Creating and Sustaining.
  The Sympathising and Suffering.
  The Regenerating and Sanctifying.
The first of the three clauses tries to indicate
briefly the cosmic, as well as the more humanly
intelligible, attributes of Deity; and to suggest an
idea of creation appropriate to the doctrine of Divine
Immanence, as opposed to the anthropomorphic
notion of manufacture. The idea of evolution by
guiding and controlling Purpose is suggested, as
well as the vital conception of Fatherly Love.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c013'>In the second paragraph, Time and Place are explicitly
mentioned in order to emphasise the historical
and human aspect of the Christian manifestation of
Godhead. This aspect is essential and easy to
appreciate, though its idealisation and full interpretation
are difficult. The step, from the bare historic facts
to the idealisation of the Fourth Gospel, has been the
work of the Church, in the best sense of that word,
aided by the doctrines of the Logos and of Immanence,
elaborated by Philosophy. It all hangs together,
when properly grasped, and constitutes a luminous
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>conception; but the light thus shed upon the nature of
Deity must not blind our eyes to the simple human
facts from which it originally emanated. The clear and
undoubted fact is that the founder of the Christian
religion lived on this earth a blameless life, taught and
helped the poor who heard him gladly, gathered to
himself a body of disciples with whom he left a
message to mankind, and was put to death as a
criminal blasphemer, at the instigation of mistaken
priests in the defence of their own Order and
privileges.</p>

<p class='c013'>This monstrous wrong is regarded by some as
having unconsciously completed the salvation of the
race; because of the consummation of sacrifice, and
because of the suffering of the innocent, which it
involved. The Jewish sacrificial system, and the
priestly ceremony of the scapegoat, seem to lead up
to that idea; which was elaborated by St. Paul with
immense genius, and taught by S. Augustine.</p>

<p class='c013'>Others attach more saving efficacy to the life, the
example, and the teachings, as recorded in the
Gospels; and all agree that they are important.</p>

<p class='c013'>But in fact the whole is important: and at the foot
of the Cross there has been a perennial experience
of relief and renovation. Sin being the sense of
imperfection, disunion, lack of harmony, the struggle
among the members that St. Paul for all time expressed;—there
is usually associated with it a sense
of impotence, a recognition of the impossibility of
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>achieving peace and unity in one’s own person, a
feeling that aid must be forthcoming from a higher
source. It is this feeling which enables the spectacle
of any noble self-sacrificing human action to have an
elevating effect, it is this which gropes after the
possibilities of the highest in human nature, it is a
feeling which for large tracts of this planet has found
its highest stimulus and completest satisfaction in
the life and death of Christ.</p>

<p class='c013'>The willingness of such a Being to share our
nature, to live the life of a peasant, and to face the
horrible certainty of execution by torture, in order
personally to help those whom he was pleased to
call his brethren, is a race-asset which, however
masked and overlaid with foreign growths, yet gleams
through every covering and suffuses the details of
common life with fragrance.</p>

<p class='c013'>This conspicuously has been a redeeming, or rather
a regenerating, agency;—for by filling the soul with
love and adoration and fellow-feeling for the Highest,
the old cravings have often been almost hypnotically
rendered distasteful and repellent, the bondage of
sin has been loosened from many a spirit, the lower
entangled self has been helped from the slough of
despond and raised to the shores of a larger hope,
whence it can gradually attain to harmony and peace.</p>

<p class='c013'>The invitation to the troubled soul—“Come, and
find rest”—has reference, not to relief from sin alone,
but to all restlessness and lack of trust. The Atonement
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>removes the feeling of dislocation; it induces a
tranquil sense of security and harmony,—an assurance
of union with the Divine will.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every form of Christianity aims at salvation for the
race and for each individual, both soul and body;
but different versions differ as to the means most
efficient to this end. Varieties of Christianity can be
grouped under the symbolic names, Paul, James,
Peter, and John; with the dominating ideas of
vicarious sacrifice, human effort, Church ordinance,
and loving-kindness, respectively.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the coldest system of nomenclature these four
chief varieties may be styled, <i>legal</i>, <i>ethical</i>, <i>ecclesiastical</i>,
and <i>emotional</i>, respectively. More favourably
regarded, the dominating ideas may be classified
thus:—</p>
<table class='table2' summary=''>
<colgroup>
<col width='9%' />
<col width='90%' />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>1.</td>
    <td class='c017'>Faith in a divine scheme of redemption.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>2.</td>
    <td class='c017'>Simple life, social service, honesty, and virtue.</td>
  </tr>

    <td class='c017'>Spiritual sustenance by utilisation of means of grace.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>4.</td>
    <td class='c017'>Obedience, unworldliness, trust, and love.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c013'>With the treatment of these great themes, sectarian
differences begin: differences which seem beyond our
power to reconcile. We need not dwell on the
differences, we would rather emphasise the mass of
agreement. Probably there is an element of truth in
every view that has long been held and found helpful
by human beings, however overlaid with superstition
it may in some cases have become; and probably also
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>the truth is far from exhausted by any one estimate
of the essential feature of a Life which most of us
can agree to recognise as a revelation of the high-water-mark
of manhood, and a manifestation of the
human attributes of God.</p>

<p class='c013'>None of the above partially overlapping subdivisions
of Christianity equals in importance the overshadowing
and dominating theory emphasised in the
above creed: namely, the idea of a veritable incarnation
of Divine Spirit—a visible manifestation of Deity
immanent in humanity. The facts of the life, testified
to by witnesses and idealised by philosophers and
saints, have been transmitted down the centuries by
a continuous Church; though with a mingling of
superstition and error.</p>

<p class='c013'>At present the process of interpretation has been
accompanied by a sad amount of discord and hostility,
to the scandal of the Church; but the future of
religion shall not always be endangered by suspicion
and intolerance and narrowness among professed
disciples of truth. There must come a time when
first a nation, and afterwards the civilised world, shall
awake and glory in the light of the risen sun:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in26'>“—A sun but dimly seen</div>
      <div class='line'>Here, till the mortal morning mists of earth</div>
      <div class='line'>Fade in the noon of heaven, when creed and race</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall bear false witness, each of each, no more,</div>
      <div class='line'>But find their limits by that larger light,</div>
      <div class='line'>And overstep them, moving easily</div>
      <div class='line'>Thro’ after-ages in the love of Truth,</div>
      <div class='line'>The truth of Love.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>The emphasis laid by the above explanation on the
conception of the human nature incorporated into
Godhead, is appropriate to this country and to the
Western World generally; but we thereby imply no
abuse of the religions of the East, in their proper place,
any more than of the religions of other planets. Silence
concerning them is not disrespectful. It is not to be
supposed that any one world has a monopoly of the
Grace of God; nor does it exhaust every plan of
salvation. In estimating the value of another dispensation,
or of any ill-understood religion (and no
one can perfectly understand and appreciate more
than one religion, if that, to the full), the old test is
the only valid one: Do men gather grapes of thorns
or figs of thistles?</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c013'>The third paragraph speaks of our progress along the
Way of Truth to goodness and beauty of Life, and of
the assistance constantly vouchsafed to our own efforts
in that direction. It is not by our own efforts alone
that we can succeed, for we cannot tell what lies
before us, and we lack wisdom to foresee the consequences
of alternative courses of action,—one of
which nevertheless we instinctively feel to be right.
Acts of self-will, and fanatical determination, and
impatience, may operate in the wrong direction
altogether; and effort so expended may be worse
than wasted. But if we submit ourselves wholly to a
beneficent Power, and seek not our own ends but
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>the ends of the Guiding Spirit of all things, we shall
obtain peace in ourselves, and may hope to be used
for purposes beyond what we can ask or think.
This kind of service is what, in its several degrees,
will be recognised by the Master as “faithful”; and
it is by being faithful in a few things that hereafter we
shall be found worthy of many things, and shall
enter into the joy of our Lord.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the Holy Spirit is meant the living and immanent
Deity at work in the consciousness and experience
of mankind,—the guider of human history, the
comforter of human sorrow, the revealer of truth, the
inspirer of faith and hope and love, the producer of
life and joy and beauty, the sustainer and enricher
of existence, the Impersonation of the Grace of God.</p>

<p class='c013'>This mighty theme has been treated, in an initial
manner, in connexion with Clause XIII.</p>

<p class='c013'>Supplementary questions will be asked concerning
other terms in the third paragraph; but as to the
phrase with which the Creed concludes—the Peace
of God,—its meaning, we are well assured, surpasses
understanding, and can be felt only by experience;
hence no supplementary question is asked concerning
that phrase.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XVI<br /> <br />THE LIFE ETERNAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 16.  What do you mean by the Life
Eternal?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> I mean that, whereas our terrestrial existence
is temporary, our real existence continues
without ceasing, in either a higher or a lower
form, according to our use of opportunities and
means of grace; and that the fulness of Life
ultimately attainable represents a growing
perfection at present inconceivable by us.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
  <h2 class='c022'>CLAUSE XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Continuity of existence, without break or interruption,
is the fundamental idea that needs inculcation,
not only among children but among ignorant people
generally. And the survival, from savage times, of an
inclination to associate a full measure of departed
personality with the discarded and decomposing
bodily remnant,—under the impression that it will
awake and live again at some future day,—should be
steadily discouraged. The idea of bodily resurrection,
in this physical sense, is responsible for much superstition
and for some ecclesiastical abuses.</p>

<p class='c013'>A nearer approach to the truth may be expressed
thus:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Terrestrial existence is dependent for its continuance
on a certain arrangement of material particles
belonging to the earth, which are gradually collected
and built up into the complex and constantly
changing structure called a body. The correspondence
or connection between matter and spirit, as thus
exhibited, is common to every form of life in some
degree, and is probably a symbol or sample of something
permanently true; so that a double aspect of
every fundamental existence is likely always to
continue. But identity of person in no way depends
upon identity of particles: the particles are frequently
changed and the old ones discarded.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>The term “body” should be explained and
emphasised, as connoting anything which is able to
manifest feelings, emotions, and thoughts, and at the
same time to operate efficiently on its environment.
The temporary character of the present human body
should be admitted for purposes of religion; it
usefully and truthfully displays the incarnate part of
us during the brief episode of terrestrial life, and
when it has served its turn it is left behind, its
particles being discarded and dispersed. Hereafter—we
are taught—an equally efficient vehicle of
manifestation, similarly appropriate to our new
environment, will not be lacking; this at present
unknown and hypothetical entity is spoken of as “a
spiritual body,” and represents the serious idea underlying
crude popular notions about bodily resurrection.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>ego</i> has been likened to a ripple raised by
wind upon water, displaying in visible form the motion
and influence of the operating breath, without being
permanently differentiated from the vast whole, of
which each ripple is a temporarily individualised portion:
individualised, yet not isolated from others,
but connected with them by the ocean, of whose
immensity it may be supposed for poetic purposes
gradually to become aware:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But that one ripple on the boundless deep</div>
      <div class='line'>Feels that the deep is boundless, and itself</div>
      <div class='line'>For ever changing form, but evermore</div>
      <div class='line'>One with the boundless motion of the deep.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>There is much to be said for some form of doctrine
of a common psychological basis or union of minds—some
kind of Anima Mundi, some World-Mind, of
which we are all fragments, and to which all knowledge
is in a manner accessible; but the analogy of
ocean ripples or icebergs need not be pressed to support
the idea of a cessation of individual existence,
when a given ripple or a given iceberg subsides.
All analogies fail at some point. The ocean analogy
happens to suggest indistinguishable absorption, or
Nirvana, but others do not. The parts of a jelly are
linked together and vibrate as a whole, but each
little sac of fluid is partitioned off as an individual
entity; in touch with all the rest, but with a texture
and a colour of its own.</p>

<p class='c013'>Continued personality, persistent individual existence,
cannot be predicated of things which do not
possess personality or individuality or character: but,
to things which do possess these attributes, continuity
and persistence not only may, but must, apply; unless
we are to suppose that actual existence suddenly
ceases. There must be a conservation of character;
notwithstanding the admitted return of the individual
to a central store or larger self, from which a portion
was differentiated and individualised for the brief
period during which the planet performs some
seventy of its innumerable journeys round the sun.
Absorption in original source may mask, but need
not destroy, identity.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>Even so a villager, picked out as a recruit and sent
to the seat of war, may serve his country, may gain
experience, acquire a soul and a width of horizon
such as he had not dreamt of; and when he returns,
after the war is over, may be merged as before in his
native village. But the village is the richer for his
presence, and his individuality or personality is not
really lost; though to the eye of the world, which has
no further need for it, it has practically ceased to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>The character and experience gained by us during
our brief association with the matter of this planet,
become our possession henceforth for ever. We cannot
shake ourselves free of them, even if we would: the
enlargement of ideas, the growth in knowledge, the
acquisition of friendships, the skill and power and
serviceableness attained by us through this strange
experience of incarnation, all persist as part and
parcel of our larger self; and so do the memories of
failure, of shame, of cruelty, of sin, which we have
acquired here. To glory in these last things is
damnation: the best that they can bring to us is
pain and undying remorse—their worm dieth not and
the fire is not quenched. There is no way out, save
by the way of mercy and grace; whereby we are
assured that at last, in the long last, we may
ultimately attain to pardon and peace.</p>

<p class='c013'>The class of things which is certainly not persistent,
but must indubitably be left behind us for ever, is
the weird collection of treasures for which most of us
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>work so hard: scorning delights and living laborious
days for their acquisition.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this blind and mistaken struggle—a struggle
which in the present condition of society seems so
unavoidable, even so meritorious, but which in a
reformed society will be looked back upon as at
something akin to lunacy—we do not even make to
ourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness.
Its mottoes are “each for himself” and “væ victis.”
Fortunately very few of the human race wholly
succumb to this temptation; nearly all reserve great
regions of their lives where kindness and friendliness
and affection reign, and try to check the evil results
of their worser or self-directed efforts by charitable
doles.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a more ideal state of society there would be no
need either of the poison or of its antidote.</p>

<p class='c013'>To bring about such an ideal state of society is
the end and aim of Politics, and of all movements
for social reform. Efforts in these directions are
the most serious things in life, and may be the
most fruitful in vital results: since few individuals
are strong enough to withstand the pressure and
tendency of their social surroundings. Only a few
can rise superior to them, only a few sink far
beneath them; the majority drift with the crowd
and become—too many at present—irretrievably
injured by the base and ugly conditions among
which their lives are cast.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>At present, for the majority of Englishmen, life is
liable to be damaging and deleterious: initial weakness
of character, so far from being strengthened
and helped by the combined force of society, is
hindered and enfeebled thereby,—a disastrous and
disquieting condition of things. But when the efforts
of self-sacrificing and laborious statesmen, Ministers
in the highest sense (Mark x. 43),—when these
efforts at cultivation bear fruit,—then, notwithstanding
individual lapses here and there, society at large
will be indistinguishable from a human branch of the
Communion of Saints. Then will feeble impulses
towards virtue be fostered and encouraged; the bruised
reed will no longer be broken and trampled in the
mire.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Life Eternal in its fullest sense must be
entered upon here and now. The emphasis is on
the word <i>Life</i>, without reference to time. “I am
come that ye might have Life.” Life of a far
higher kind than any we yet know is attainable
by the human race on this planet. It rests largely
with ourselves. The outlook was never brighter than
it is to-day; many workers and thinkers are making
ready the way for a Second Advent,—a reincarnation
of the Logos in the heart of all men; the heralds
are already attuning their songs for a reign of
brotherly love; already there are “signs of his
coming and sounds of his feet”; and upon our
terrestrial activity the date of this Advent depends.</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 17.  What is the significance of the “Communion
of Saints”?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> Higher and holier beings must possess,
in fuller fruition, those privileges of communion
which are already foreshadowed by our own
faculties of language, of sympathy, and of
mutual aid; and as we find that man’s power
of friendly help is not confined to his fellows,
but extends to other animals, so may we conceive
ourselves part of a mighty Fellowship of
love and service.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
  <h2 class='c022'>CLAUSE XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Here is opened up a great subject on which much
remains to be discovered. It is probable that the
action of the Deity throughout the Universe is
always conducted through intermediaries and
agents. In all cases that we can examine, it is
so; and this is one of the many meanings of
“Immanence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Humanity is the most prominent, to us, among
Divine agencies, and though it is probably only an
infinitesimal fraction of the whole, yet it can be
studied as a sample. Experience shows us that
human beings have feelings of sympathy, pity, and
love, and can be moved to act in certain ways by
persistent urging and by definite requests. There
is no reason to suppose that this faculty of hearing
and answering is limited to our own comparatively
lowly stage of existence. Man may be regarded as
a germ or indication of far more powerful agencies,
of which at present we know very little.</p>

<p class='c013'>The faculty of communion familiarly possessed by
man is not likely to be exhaustive of all possible
methods of mental and spiritual intercourse; and, in
the undeveloped power of telepathy, we have an indication
of a mode apparently not dependent on the
machinery of physical processes, and not necessarily
limited to intelligences inhabiting the surface of a
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>planet. Why associate mind only with the surface of
a mass of matter? Enthusiasts hope some day to be
able to communicate with people on Mars, but there
may be intelligences far more accessible to us than
those remote and hypothetical denizens of another
world. The immanent Spirit of nature is likely to
individualise and personify itself in ways mysterious
and unknown: all manner of possibilities lie open to
our study and examination; and—until we have
scrutinised the evidence, and thought long and
deeply on the subject—our negative opinion, based
upon long habit and tradition, must not be allowed
undue weight. It must be remembered that the
above is speculation, not knowledge; yet something
like it has received the sanction of great philosophers.
Here is an exclamation of Hegel:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“We do not mean to be behind; our watchword
shall be Reason and Freedom, and our rallying
ground the Invisible Church.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So far our eyes are open to perceive only the
assiduous operations of man; and any supposed
influence of other agencies we regard with suspicion
and mistrust. Some are inclined to think that man
is solitary in the universe, the highest of created
things; without equal, without superior, without
companionship; alone with his indomitable soul
amid scenes of unspeakable grandeur and awe;
alone with his brethren in a universe wherein no
spark of feeling, no gleam of intelligence, can be
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>aroused by his unuttered longings, no echo of sympathy
can respond to his bewildered need.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet that is not the feeling which arises during
spells of lonely communion with nature, on rock or
sea or trackless waste. At these moments comes a
sense of Presence, such as Wordsworth felt at
Tintern, or Byron when he wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then stirs the feeling infinite, so felt</div>
      <div class='line'>In solitude, where we are <i>least</i> alone.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Until our senses are opened more widely, scepticism
concerning spiritual beings, as intermediate
links with absolute Deity, may be our safest attitude,
for ignorance is better than superstition; but the
seers of the human race have surmised that as
denizens of a higher universe we are far from lonely,
that it is only our limited perception that is at fault,
and that to clearer eyes the whole of nature is transfused
with spirit: ἡ φυχὴ τῷ ὅλῳ μέμιϰται,</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XVIII<br /> <br />MYSTIC COMMUNION OR PRAYER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 18.  What do you understand by prayer?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> I understand that when our spirits are
attuned to the Spirit of Righteousness, our
hopes and aspirations exert an influence far
beyond their conscious range, and in a true sense
bring us into communion with our Heavenly
Father. This power of filial communion is called
prayer; it is an attitude of mingled worship and
supplication; we offer petitions in a spirit of
trust and submission, and endeavour to realise
the Divine attributes, with the help and example
of Christ.</p>

  <h2 class='c022'>CLAUSE XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In prayer we come into close communion with a
Higher than we know, and seek to contemplate
Divine perfection. Its climax and consummation is
attained when we realise the universal Permeance,
the entire Goodness, and the Fatherly Love, of the
Divine Being. Through prayer we admit our dependence
on a Higher Power, for existence and health
and everything we possess; we are encouraged to
ask for whatever we need, as children ask parents;
and we inevitably cry for mercy and comfort in
times of tribulation and anguish.</p>

<p class='c013'>The spirit of simple supplication may desire

<p class='c013'>But provided we ask in a right spirit, it is not
necessary to be specially careful concerning the kind
of things asked for; nor need we in all cases attempt
to decide how far their attainment is possible or not.
In such matters we may admit our ignorance. What
is important is that we should apply our own efforts
towards the fulfilment of our petition, and not be
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>satisfied with wishes alone. Everything accomplished
has to be done by actual work and activity of some
kind, and it is unreasonable to expect the rest of the
universe to take trouble on our behalf while we ourselves
are supine. Certain material means are within
our control: these should be fully employed, in the
light of the best knowledge of the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>The highest type of prayer has for its object not
any material benefit, beyond those necessary for our
activity and usefulness, but the enlightenment and
amendment of our wills, the elevation of all humanity,
and the coming of the Kingdom.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XX<br /> <br />THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Q. 20.  What is meant by the Kingdom of
Heaven?</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>A.</i> The Kingdom of Heaven is the central
feature of practical Christianity. It represents
a harmonious condition in which the Divine
Will is perfectly obeyed; it signifies the highest
state of existence, both individual and social,
which we can conceive. Our whole effort
should, directly or indirectly, make ready its
way,—in our hearts, in our lives, and in the
lives of others. It is the ideal state of society
towards which Reformers are striving; it is the
ideal of conscious existence towards which
Saints aim.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
  <h2 class='c022'>CLAUSE XX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This mighty ideal has many aspects. It has been
typified as the pearl of great price, for which all other
possessions may well be sacrificed: in germ it is as
leaven, or as growing seed. It will come sooner
than is expected, though for a time longer there
must be tares among the wheat: for a time longer
there shall be last and first, and a striving to be
greatest, and a laying up of earthly treasure, and wars
and divisions; but only for a time,—the spirit of service
is growing, and the childlike spirit will overcome:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good
pleasure to give you the Kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When realised, it will conduce to universal love
and brotherhood; it is the reign of Christ’s spirit in
the hearts of all men; it is accordingly spoken of as
the second Advent, and its herald song is still, Peace
on earth, goodwill among men. Wherever perfect
love and willing service exist, there already is the
Kingdom.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have to realise that the Will of God is to
be done on earth, that the Kingdom of Heaven is
to be a present Kingdom, here and now, not
relegated indefinitely to the future. Our life is not
in the future, but in the present, and it will always
be in the present: it is in our life that we have to
apply our beliefs, utilise our talents, and bring forth
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>fruit. The Kingdom of Heaven is not only at hand,
it is potentially in our midst, and may be actually
within us. These are its two chief aspects, the social,
and the individual. The ideal is to be made real, in
each and in all: nothing is too good to be true: each
soul is to attain its highest aim: the world is to be
transfigured and transformed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The above formula must not be supposed to
exhaust the meaning of the great Phrase, which
many parables have still only partially explained,
but it is a part of its meaning. And the strange
thing is that the world, with all its competition,
wrestling and contending amid unheeded calls to
order, is really working towards that goal. No other
ending is possible in the long run, though it has been
long delayed. It is the condition towards which the
whole of humanity, each individual man, as well as
the race, is blindly and unconsciously struggling;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Their prejudice and fears and cares and doubts</div>
      <div class='line'>All with a touch of nobleness; despite</div>
      <div class='line'>Their error, upward tending all, though weak,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like plants in mines which never saw the sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>But dream of him and guess where he may be,</div>
      <div class='line'>And do their best to climb and get to him.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The daily toil, in city office, in factory, in ship, in
mine, in home, is really a struggle for Life, for freedom,
for joy, for something wider and better than we at present
know, for pleasures that satisfy and do not pall.
We needs must love the highest when we see it, but
as yet we do not see it: so we are working in the
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>dark, and the best of us try hard to do our duty. The
end is unrecognised, the means may be mistaken, but
the energy is there; and the race as well as the individual
is instinctively working out its destiny;—thwarting
itself constantly by misdirected endeavour, yet
constantly striving for self-development and enlargement,
for progress and happiness. And this is true
even when the main idea of enlargement is the
amassing of money in unwieldy heaps, when happiness
is sought in an exaltation of imagination by
deleterious drugs, or when progress is thought to
consist in the slaughter and impoverishment of
opponents who might be our auxiliaries and allies.</p>

<p class='c013'>If our vision could be cleared, and the aim of
human effort could be changed, the earth would
put on a new complexion; we should no longer be
tempted to think of humanity as of an ancient and
effete and played-out product of evolution,—we the
latest-born and most youthful of all the creatures on
the planet,—but should regard everything with the
eye of hope, as of one new born, with senses
quickened to perceive joys and beauties hitherto
undreamt of.</p>

<p class='c013'>That is the meaning of Regeneration or new birth:
it must be like an awakening out of trance. At
present we are as if subject to a dream illusion,
in a slumber which we are unable to throw off.
Revelation after revelation has come to us, but our
senses are deadened and we will not hear, our hands
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>are full of clay, we have no grasp for ideals, we are
mistaking appearance for reality. But the time for
awakening must be drawing nigh—the time when again
it may be said: “The people that walked in darkness
have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land
of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light
shined.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile our seers depict man’s half-hoping half-despairing
attitude, not so much as a striving, as a
waiting:—the striving is obvious, but the unconscious
waiting is what they detect—waiting as it were for
the arrival of a new sense, a new perception of the
value of life:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And we, the poor earth’s dying race, and yet</div>

      <div class='line'>Await the last and largest sense to make</div>
      <div class='line'>The phantom walls of this illusion fade,</div>
      <div class='line'>And show us that the world is wholly fair.”</div>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE CATECHISM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 1.  What are you?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> I am a being alive and conscious upon this
earth, a descendant of ancestors who rose by gradual
processes from lower forms of animal life, and with
struggle and suffering became man.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 2.  What, then, may be meant by the Fall of man?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> At a certain stage of development man became
conscious of a difference between right and wrong, so
that thereafter, when his actions fell below a normal
standard of conduct, he felt ashamed and sinful.
He thus lost his animal innocency, and entered on a
long period of human effort and failure; nevertheless,
the consciousness of degradation marked a rise in
the scale of existence.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 3.  What is the distinctive character of manhood?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> The distinctive character of man is that he has
a sense of responsibility for his acts, having acquired
the power of choosing between good and evil, with
freedom to obey one motive rather than another.
Creatures far below the human level are irresponsible;
they feel no shame and suffer no remorse; they are
said to have no conscience.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span><i>Q. 4.  What is the duty of man?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> To assist his fellows, to develop his own higher
self, to strive towards good in every way open to his
powers, and generally to seek to know the laws of
Nature and to obey the will of God; in whose service
alone can be found that harmonious exercise of the
faculties which is identical with perfect freedom.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 5.  What is meant by good and evil?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> Good is that which promotes development, and
is in harmony with the will of God. It is akin to
health and beauty and happiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evil is that which retards or frustrates development,
and injures some part of the universe. It is akin to
disease and ugliness and misery.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 6.  How does man know good from evil?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> His own nature, when uncorrupted by greed, is
sufficiently in harmony with the rest of the universe
to enable him to be well aware in general of what is
a help or a hindrance to the guiding Spirit, of which
he himself is a real and effective portion.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 7.  How comes it that evil exists?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> Evil is not an absolute thing, but has reference
to a standard of attainment. The possibility of evil
is the necessary consequence of a rise in the scale of
moral existence; just as an organism whose normal
temperature is far above “absolute zero” is necessarily
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>liable to damaging and deadly cold. But cold is not
in itself a positive or created thing.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 8.  What is sin?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> Sin is the deliberate and wilful act of a free
agent who sees the better and chooses the worse, and
thereby acts injuriously to himself and others. The
root sin is selfishness, whereby needless trouble and
pain are inflicted on others; when fully developed it
involves moral suicide.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 9.  Are there beings lower in the scale of existence
than man?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> Yes, multitudes. In every part of the earth
where life is possible, there we find it developed.
Life exists in every variety of animal, in earth and
air and sea, and in every species of plant.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 10.  Are there any beings higher in the scale of
existence than man?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> Man is the highest of the dwellers on the planet
earth, but the earth is only one of many planets
warmed by the sun, and the sun is only one of a
myriad of similar suns, which are so far off that
we barely see them and group them indiscriminately
as “stars.” We may reasonably conjecture that in
some of the innumerable worlds circling round
those distant suns there must be beings far higher in
the scale of existence than ourselves; indeed, we
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>have no knowledge which enables us to assert the
absence of intelligence anywhere.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 11.  What caused and what maintains existence?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> Of our own knowledge we are unable to realise
the meaning of origination or of maintenance; all
that we ourselves can accomplish in the physical
world is to move things into desired positions, and
leave them to act on each other. Nevertheless our
effective movements are inspired by thought, and so
we conceive that Intelligence is immanent in all the
processes of nature; for they are not random and
purposeless, but organised and beautiful.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 12.  What is to be said of man’s higher faculties?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> The faculties and achievements of the highest
among mankind—in Art, in Science, in Philosophy,
and in Religion—are not explicable as an outcome of
a struggle for existence. Something more than mere
life is possessed by us—something represented by the
words “mind” and “soul” and “spirit.” On one side
we are members of the animal kingdom; on another
we are associates in a loftier type of existence, and
are linked with the Divine.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 13.  Is man helped in his struggle upward?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> There is a Power in the Universe vastly
beyond our comprehension; and we trust and believe
that it is a Good and Loving Power, able and
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>willing to help us and all creatures, and to guide us
wisely, without detriment to our incipient freedom.
This Loving-kindness continually surrounds us; in
it we live and have our real being; it is the mainspring
of joy and love and beauty, and we call it
the Grace of God. It sustains and enriches all worlds,
and may take a multiplicity of forms, but it was
specially manifested to dwellers on this planet in the
Life of Jesus Christ, through whose spirit and living
influence the race of man may hope to rise to heights
at present inaccessible.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 14.  How may we become informed concerning
things too high for our own knowledge?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> We should strive to learn from the great
teachers, the prophets and poets and saints of the
human race, and should seek to know and to interpret
their inspired writings.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 15.  What, then, do you reverently believe can be
deduced from a study of the records and traditions of
the past in the light of the present?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> I believe in one Infinite and Eternal Being,
a guiding and loving Father, in whom all things
consist.</p>

<p class='c013'>I believe that the Divine Nature is specially revealed
to man through Jesus Christ our Lord, who
lived and taught and suffered in Palestine 1900 years
ago, and has since been worshipped by the Christian
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>Church as the immortal Son of God, the Saviour of
the world.</p>

<p class='c013'>I believe that the Holy Spirit is ever ready to help
us along the Way towards Goodness and Truth; that
prayer is a means of communion between man and
God; and that it is our privilege through faithful service
to enter into the Life Eternal, the Communion
of Saints, and the Peace of God.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 16.  What do you mean by the Life Eternal?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> I mean that whereas our terrestrial existence
is temporary, our real existence continues without
ceasing, in either a higher or a lower form, according
to our use of opportunities and means of grace; and
that the fulness of Life ultimately attainable represents
a growing perfection at present inconceivable
by us.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q. 17.  What is the significance of “the Communion
of Saints”?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> Higher and holier beings must possess, in fuller
fruition, those privileges of communion which are
already foreshadowed by our own faculties of
language, of sympathy, and of mutual aid; and as
we know that man’s power of friendly help is not
confined to his fellows, but extends to other animals,
so may we conceive ourselves part of a mighty
Fellowship of love and service.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span><i>Q. 18.  What do you understand by prayer?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> I understand that when our spirits are attuned
to the Spirit of Righteousness, our hopes and aspirations
exert an influence far beyond their conscious
range, and in a true sense bring us into communion
with our Heavenly Father. This power of filial communion
is called prayer; it is an attitude of mingled
worship and supplication; we offer petitions in a
spirit of trust and submission, and endeavour to
realise the Divine attributes, with the help and
example of Christ.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Q.  Rehearse the prayer taught us by Jesus.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> Our Father, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Q. 19.  Explain the clauses of this prayer.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> We first attune our spirit to consciousness of
the Divine Fatherhood; trying to realise His infinite
holiness as well as His loving-kindness, desiring that
everything alien to His will should cease in our hearts
and in the world, and longing for the establishment
of the Kingdom of Heaven. Then we ask for the
supply of the ordinary needs of existence, and for
the forgiveness of our sins and shortcomings as we
pardon those who have hurt us. We pray to be kept
from evil influences, and to be protected when they
attack us. Finally, we repose in the might, majesty,
and dominion of the Eternal Goodness.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span><i>Q. 20.  What is meant by the Kingdom of Heaven?</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A.</i> The Kingdom of Heaven is the central feature
of practical Christianity. It represents a harmonious
condition in which the Divine Will is perfectly
obeyed; it signifies the highest state of existence,
both individual and social, which we can conceive.
Our whole effort should, directly or indirectly, make
ready its way,—in our hearts, in our lives, and in the
lives of others. It is the ideal state of society towards
which Reformers are striving; it is the ideal of
conscious existence towards which Saints aim.</p>

<h4 class='c040'><b>Methuen’s Standard Library</b><br /><i>In Sixpenny Volumes.</i></h4>

<p class='c047'><span class='sc'>The Standard Library</span> is a new series of volumes containing the great classics of the
world, and particularly the finest works of English literature. All the great masters will be
represented, either in complete works or in selections. It is the ambition of the publishers to
place the best books of the Anglo-Saxon race within the reach of every reader, so that the
series may represent something of the diversity and splendour of our English tongue. The
characteristics of <span class='sc'>The Standard Library</span> are four:—1. <span class='sc'>Soundness of Text.</span> 2. <span class='sc'>Cheapness.</span>
3. <span class='sc'>Clearness of Type.</span> 4. <span class='sc'>Simplicity.</span> The books are well printed on good paper at a
price which on the whole is without parallel in the history of publishing. Each volume contains
from 100 to 250 pages, and is issued in paper covers, Crown 8vo, at Sixpence net, or in
cloth gilt at One Shilling net. In a few cases long books are issued as Double Volumes
or as Treble Volumes.</p>

text in the Revised Version as their basis, they will try to combine a hearty acceptance
of critical principles with loyalty to the Catholic Faith.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
